## My Vision for Wealth

Wealth to me is the freedom to support my life as I need to. I no longer see traditional stock market investing as a viable long-term strategy. Wealth now means the people around me—cooperatively supporting one another and building resilience through mutual care.

Financial sovereignty means I am no longer bound by the golden handcuffs of any particular system. I want to make decisions based on how to make money work for me and my values, not be held hostage by the tax code or financial norms.

Money should be a tool that supports both my life and my community. It should be actively building systems that will care for me as I age, not just leave me in a retirement home waiting to die. I want to share whatever systems I build with those around me. As I grow older and need more care from others, I want the resources I’ve stewarded to nourish the people who are part of that circle.

Enough looks like a community of supportive people around me—a village of 50 to 150 humans living in connection with each other, the land, and the wider web of life.

## What No Longer Feels Aligned

I am no longer aligned with the extractive nature of Wall Street. The systems of capitalism, consumerism, and “power over” extract life force from humans to concentrate wealth into the hands of a few. I want to offer my money, wisdom, and experience directly to those around me and receive other resources in return—strength, community, and access to nature.

I no longer have faith in the U.S. government, the dollar's reserve currency status, or the long-term stability of the stock market. Each of these feels increasingly unstable. As I age, I want to transition toward real-world, resilient, and relational forms of investment.

I’m ready to step away from the illusion of growth that the stock market provides—the fantasy that it will be there for me when I need it. If I don’t move this money into something real, I fear it will just rot.

## What I Want Instead

I want to live in a world of mutual aid, where people care for one another and systems are designed to uplift humans, not extract dollars from them. A world that values giving, reusing, and nurturing—people and planet alike.

I feel most connected to investments that bring people together, that support community, and that generate shared wealth—not individual isolation.

I have visions of building my own village, and I’m open to investing in projects that are already forming.

## Fears and Resistance

My biggest concern is missed opportunity: the market might go up; the investments I choose might fail. I fear not having access to cash when I need it.

The worst case scenario? Losing the current value of my market holdings, losing the quality of life I’ve come to rely on, and the flexibility to move or shift course when needed.

There’s a part of me that wants to remain stable and provide a safe base for those who depend on me. It’s the part that was trained to be responsible, respectable, and realistic. I want to listen to that part and care for its needs while still moving forward.

## Encouragement from My Future Self

Wow. That decade went fast.

It was such a wise choice to leave the market when you did. The downturn would have hurt your portfolio badly—but instead, you’re in a place of abundance. You made the leap into trust, and it paid off in ways you couldn’t yet see.

Thank you for being decisive and bold—for walking into the unknown and trusting that support would rise to meet you.

Now, I feel so grounded, strong, and healthy in this village. Everyone around me has a role, a place, and the nurturing care they need. This life is not just secure—it’s alive.
