Voice memo we're going. Can you pet? Are you sure it's actually hearing him?  Yes, it's here.. Um. So, the first thing that came to me is that, like, what's the very basic thing about being at an authentic relating games?  It's you go so that you can, like, be seen felt. I I think even encounter yourself. Right, encounter yourself and also encounter the other, but in bite sized chunks from different angles.  So it might be from a parts work lens or a movement lens, or. Today, I guess we did today's guru is parts work, like h yourself, kind of. Yeah.  But, what if we. We haven't played that one much. What if we actually played Higher Self?  Oh, you're right. I don't think we I don't think we have played it. That sounds fun.  But it's a little bit. It's kind of. You're kind of on the spot, right?  Or no, people ask you questions. So it's kind of like fly on the wall or whatever. Well, it's, the setup is usually, you know, you..  I'm not sinking your. Sink in your higher self, and then other people will ask you questions about the person. About yourself.  Like, what do you think is is your biggest challenge right now? Right. And then Barbara's concerned with that game was, you know, sort of people going down the path of, you know, oh, higher self.  What color is the. You know, this person's favorite shirt or something, you know. Okay, right, so we're like, so the goal is to seek our intuition and to see if we can let go and let's let the, you know, it seems like the obvious answer or the silly answer or whatever come out, but like, leaning towards authenticity.  Yeah. And instead of siness or specific. And so what what if we did, is there something that we could do to make it like a two-stage game?  Well, maybe To an intro then. Like maybe a check-in that has a certain flavor to it. Like a one-on-one check-in.  Yeah, one-on-one check-in that has a bit of a higher self- vibe to it. That sounds good. Yeah, I wonder it'd probably be too much to add, like, higher lower cell or something, because, like, talking about lower self, does that bring the person to the lower cell?  We could bring them back and say, "Hey, you know what? We could have a ceremony, like a grieving ceremony for the the lower self or something. We can say, oh, lower self.  We're going to ask you to see this one out and we can play with you for the third round, maybe. It could be higher or lower self, maybe. I don't know if that's too spiritual, though.  It's it's hard to know where the crossing into. But you can use words like instead of higher and lower self, you could say, like yourself that wants to steal and I think higher self is neutral enough that we don't have to worry about any sort of. I Woo woo police.  All right, all right. So won't worry about that. Yeah.  Okay, so. Um.. Well, I was reading a path work that we tend to this is something I've resonated with.  I thought, oh, my gosh, I do that so much, where if you feel the power of the higher self, that you quickly, you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna use that on my problem. I just remembered." And like, it's kind of fizzes the energy.  I do this all the time to myself. Wow. Oh, I feel so good.  I want to.. Hey, tackle that. Oh, fuck.  So So, um.... Your higher self really has a thing that it wants to focus on, doesn't it? I suddenly want to use it as a tool.  Like, I want to be able to, like, clear my way or something or clear a pathway or but I can't I can't. I haven't fortified the strength of the higher self. Well, I kind of kind of imagining that you're not listening to your higher self enough because there's things that are distracting you that it doesn't want to look at.  We're other way around, like my lower self is distracting the higher hole doesn't look at it's something... Or your higher self, just like,, whatever, that's not even a thing., it's like, I want to take my wounded part along. Like, I'll be like, "Oh, I feel so powerful.  Wait a second, my parents. Whoa. I want to feel powerful around them, too.  Look at them. Oh, shoot. Now I feel shitty.  Okay. I'm gonna pause this here so we can. We'll come back to the.
