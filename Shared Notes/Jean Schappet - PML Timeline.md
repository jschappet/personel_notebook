Let me first start off by saying this is my personal record of the events related to my Mother’s diagnosis and eventual death resulting from PML.  This is in no way medical advice or recommendations.

July 2013

MONDAY, JULY 1, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

Patty took Mom to Charles region

hospital with stroke like symptoms.

They ran a few test, CT which shows possible stroke, they then did

an MRI.

The MRI ruled out stroke. They then determined they she needed to

be transferred for more extensive diagnostic work to determine the

cause of the aphasia.

JULY 2, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

At 1:30am Mom was transferred to

University of Md medical center.

They did an additional MRI with contrast. This confirmed the

exclusion of stroke and tumor.

JULY 3, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

Lumbar puncture was ordered, and

preformed with Patty in the room

Jimmy returned home to Iowa city, Patty stayed with Mom at the

hospital.

JULY 7, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

Mom was complaining about a bad

headache and they were able to

follow up with an additional MRI.

JULY 9, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

I drove from Iowa city to Baltimore,

stayed at the hotel, Tuesday night.

JULY 10, 2013 AT 11:00 AM

Stayed with Mom all day, to relive

Patty who had been in the hospital

non stop since July 2nd.

There was a bone marrow biopsy which will lead to answers about

why her white cell count is still low.

Before before breakfast she eat ó Apple with some peanut butter.

Then ate some of her breakfast, 4-5 bites.

Bone Marrow Biopsy

item. Salad, peaches, ice cream, and the Ziti.

The rest of the evening was uneventful, we had a blood draw at

11:00, Potty break at 11:35, then some additional visitors later in the

Andy Visit – Normal visit, when asked to spell world, she spelled it,

w i r l d

7:00am Neurosurgical Consult

They came by and said they don’t want to do the Brain Biopsy until

we have exhausted all the other possibilities. When asked to spell

world this time, she got it right.

7:40am Julia Visit

No news from the bone biopsy, maybe today. When we do get news

back it will still be preliminary. I asked if there was any plan for

treatment? No, we still don’t know what we are fighting.

Today Mom is not doing well with her words. She was not able to

say her name when asked.

The neuro herd came by, they are not going to do the brain biopsy,

but have no treatment for the PML.

We are going to have a consult with hematology at 3:00 or 4:00pm.

They will let us know the plan of treatment and the cause of the

underlying immuno deficiencies.

Dr. Porter is willing to call Tina and talk to her.

We have not had a good day today. Mom has been very weak and

unable to tell me her name once, she got my name right.

We had a visit from:

Speech therapy - lots of questions, some where answered maybe

25%, she was able to count from 1-20, and with a lot of prodding

was able to get the months of the year.

Grandpa and Uncle Bob -

Physical therapy - came in and we went for a little walk with the

walker. To the elevator and back.

However, the hematologist came by and told us that there is no

gross issues with the bone marrow. We are still waiting for other test

results from the bone marrow.

Occupational therapy - stopped by, Mom was already wiped out

from the trip to the bathroom and pt visit. We were able to sit up

but not remove a sock.

JULY 12, 2013 AT 5:28 PM

Dr Porter stopped by again.

He mentioned that they may be treating the immunodeficiency with

NEUPOGEN.

http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/neupogen/neupogen_pi_hcp_english.pdf

They may also be sending her home tomorrow.

Neulasta or Neupogen?

Save on Administrative, Copayments, and Transportation Costs

If you're having weekly chemo and need frequent Neupogen shots,

you can save in several ways. Ask your nurse if you can take

Neupogen shots at home, and if so, have them train you or a family

member on the proper way to give the injection. Be sure to carefully

follow the instructions for storage, preparation, and injection. This

will save you administrative costs, as well as copayments for each

office visit, and transportation costs related to each shot. You will

still have to visit your clinic for a regular CBC, to check your blood

counts, with special attention to your neutrophil levels.

Spending a little time away from the hospital with Shelby.

I'm conflicted about wanting this to be over quickly and really

hoping she gets better. Today was pretty rough, there is less and

less of my Mom in this body.

She has not had many words today, and the number of the later in

the day has been extremely low.

What can we learn from this experience?

keep good personal medical records

setup power of attorney before there is a problem

have tough conversations with the people you love

love them while they are here

I was laying here trying to sleep being southed by the sound of an

IV machine and a leg message pump worrying about my Mom

wondering how to make the phone calls when that Time comes.

And then wondering about how far way or close that may be.

Mom's resting heart rate is around 85-90bpm. The last night I was

here it was a lot closer to 50.

The hematologists seem content with waiting days to treat the low

blood count, and each day we seem to lose some of her mental

capacity. The one hope I had was that we could treat the depressed

immune system, and now we are just in a waiting game. I expect at

this point we will lose Mom, and then get a call about hemo

treatment.

I think this is enough happy thoughts for now, sorry to all the folks

you said I could call them anytime to talk. I tried one of you and

then started writing this.

Good thing this is an iPhone not paper, so you can't see the tear

stains.

Last night was an ok night but she wet herself, and we switched

over to a bedpan. She seems to be resting, at least sleeping a lot.

Her resting heart rate over night has been averaging in the high 80s.

This morning I spoke with one of the neuro docs and dr Julia. They

are now also concerned about her heart rate.

We have increased her IV fluids to 50ml/h. They are also

recommending the blood thinner as she becomes more bed ridden.

We should see the docs again later today. Hematology is still

waiting on results before treating the low white cell count.

The course of PML is a little uncertain but we are looking at weeks

to months.

Patty wanted to ask about hospice, and I forgot to mention it this

am.

We are heading home for hospice care. The long term prognosis is

not good, without being able to treat the underlying immune

problem there is little hope for her body to fight the virus.
