2017-06-12

------------------------------------------------------------

Jimmy’s called: Jacob Koller

Simmons Perrine Moyer Bergman PLC

1150 5th Street, Suite 170

Coralville, IA 52241

Phone: 319-354-1019| Fax:319-366-1917 |E-Mail: jkoller@simmonsperrine.com

Website: [www.simmonsperrine.com](http://www.simmonsperrine.com/)

I spoke with Jacob Koller, and have scheduled a meeting with him for Thursday afternoon.

Jacob charges $250/hr and I’ll have to pay that for my first meeting with him.

We have two options:

● Divorces go for $3,500

○ More we agree, and have spelled out beforehand the more we save

● Collaborative divorce

○ We each get representation, he has worked with:

■ Alison Warren Smith

■ Laura Bergus

■ Randy Welmen

○ It costs a bit more, as we would have legal fees

○ Buys a bit of protection

● One of us files and the other does not contest it

○ This would mean one of does not get legal counsel

The 90 days can be waived by the court, so it may be a moot point
