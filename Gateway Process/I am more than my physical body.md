I am more than my physical body. Because I am more than physical matter, I can perceive that which is greater than the physical world. 

Therefore, I deeply desire to Expand, to Experience; to Know, to Understand; to Control, to Use such greater energies and energy systems as may be beneficial and constructive to me and to those who follow me. 

Also, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, the assistance, the understanding of those individuals whose wisdom, development, and experience are equal to or greater than my own. 

I ask their guidance and protection from any influence or any source that might provide me with less than my stated desires.
