I was born into a song half-forgotten,  
a rhythm out of sync with the soil.  
My footsteps echoed on pavement,  
not on the skin of the Earth.

Shame came like static,  
a buzzing weight  
of ancestors who forgot how to bow.  
Guilt like dust in my lungs,  
the cost of a pace too fast for soul.

But beneath the static—  
a tone still humming.  ![[ChatGPT Image Apr 19, 2025 at 11_31_02 AM.png]]
A root-note beneath the noise:  
**Love.**

It calls me back  
not with orders,  
but with open arms.  
Not with blame,  
but with breath.

I bend, not in penance,  
but in reverence.  
I turn, not in guilt,  
but in grace.

My heart opens—  
a slow unfurling,  
like leaves meeting sun  
after the longest winter.

And now,  
I walk softer.  
I speak slower.  
I let the wind braid my thoughts  
and the rain wash my name.

I return.  
I remember.  
I re-tune.
