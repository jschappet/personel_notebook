Deer Colin,

Hello from the Pacific North West. We are just starting to move into fall here, the leaves are changing color and the smell in the air is sweet with the smell of blackberries starting to ferment on the bushes. I've been spending my time reconnecting with my own spirituality. It has been rewarding and challenging to face the super restrictive structures of the family and church along with the wonder of the connection with something greater and outside of me.
