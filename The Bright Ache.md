**(spoken softly, with space between phrases):**

I’m starting to see something I couldn’t before...

The pain I hide from those closest to me—  
it’s just the medicine I need to heal.

I’ve gotten so good at hiding it  
I can’t even feel it myself sometimes.

When I try…  
my mind blanks.  
My body feels foreign.  
All I’m left with is a dull ache in my chest  
that never quite goes away.

And then—  
someone gives me a little attention,  
and my heart crumples.  
I tear up.  
Just like that.

What must have happened to so many of us…  
that we learned to hide our pain like this?

Are feelings really so scary?  
Maybe I’m just afraid to feel mine.

I know I need help to feel.  
Mirroring.  
Presence.  
Trust.

That feels like a lot to ask.  
Could I possibly be worth that kind of effort?

(beat)

Yes.  
Yes, I am.  
And you are too.

Belonging is not something I have to earn.  
It’s something I remember—  
when I let myself be seen,  
and when I see others  
just as they are.

When I imagine them feeling—  
their joy, their pain—  
my heart softens.

A warm smile finds my face.

So here’s my intention:  
To see people where they are.  
To feel what’s true in me.  
To let my pain bring me home.  
To belong—together.
