_A historical fiction of becoming, from Jimmy to Schappet_

---

He was still Jimmy the day the world broke open.

Not the first time, not the last—but in 2019, something cracked in a way that couldn't be patched. Tina, his former wife, was getting married tomorrow. He had known, but today it hit. A quiet kind of pain. A familiar ache that had no name, except maybe _outsider_. He had always carried that one. Watching life happen through the window. People with families, inside jokes, closeness. Meanwhile, Jimmy hovered just outside, wondering if anyone noticed.

In those quiet rooms of his heart, where the old latchkey boy still waited for someone to come home, the questions returned like birds to a wire.

_Will I ever find love?_

_Why don’t I fit in?_

The therapist had once asked, “What do the tears want to say?”

And when they came, they said:

> _I want to be held._  
> _I want to be seen._  
> _Find me. I’m here._

2020 arrived like prophecy. Jimmy called it the Year of Edgy Jimmy—zero fucks to be given. He wanted to press against his edge, to crack through the shell. He danced ecstatically, moved naked through yoga flows, sought answers in circling and energy work. Somewhere, between the raw silence and the trembling voice, he found the courage to admit:

> _I am angry._  
> _I am radiant._  
> _I am powerful._

The anger he’d always shut down wasn’t a threat. It was fuel. The small fire turned out to be the sun. THE POWER OF THE SUN, he wrote. With that power came gravity. And with gravity came _presence_—not just calmness, but the gift of being a center others could rest near.

The shift was quiet but unmistakable.

The world began to respond.

His mother’s death had carved a canyon in him, long before this rebirth. PML stole her words first—then her voice, then the rest. Jimmy had written a poem from fragments on a medical site, stacking the symptoms like steps toward silence. The lines got shorter as she faded. He wanted people to understand that this wasn’t a story of hope. It was a story of _truth_—that some goodbyes are long, and final, and cruel.

That poem was a river of grief—honest and eroded. He didn’t know it then, but it was shaping him.

By 2021, Jimmy was no longer Jimmy—not in the way he had been. The old banks had been worn away. He was becoming something else. Something more... _himself._

He began building something—a village in spirit. ReVillage Society was born from that impulse: to reorient the world not around fear or control, but around _presence_, _connection_, _truth_, and _play_. A place where no one stood outside the window. A table with room. A hearth that never asked you to be different to belong.

And in that space, he became Schappet.

Not a mask, but a shedding.

Not a role, but a revelation.

Schappet wasn’t a destination. He was a turning of the river. He was what Jimmy became when the Compass finally started pointing inward—and then outward, from that place of knowing.

He spoke less to prove. He moved more to invite.

He didn’t need permission anymore.

He _was_ permission.

And his presence—still, fiery, gravitational—became a place where others laid down their burdens.

Sometimes he still cried. Sometimes the outsider ache flickered. But now, he carried it differently. As something sacred.

Because a river can change its course.

And he had.
