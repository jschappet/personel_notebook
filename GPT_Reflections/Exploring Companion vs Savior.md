## 🌿 Theme:
Moving from a rescuer/savior role into the presence of a loving companion. Letting go of responsibility to fix pain in others—especially in intimate partnership.

---

## 💔 The Old Contract
- “If I can fix her pain, everything will be okay.”
- Born in early survival patterns—empathy turned responsibility.
- Emotional pain in others triggers a compulsion to act, soothe, or solve.
- Savior/good guy archetype becomes dominant, leading to suppression of one’s own emotions.

---

## 💡 Core Realizations
- You see her tension, but pain often hides behind it.
- You’re *feeling* the pain in her, even when it’s not spoken.
- Disgust may mask heartbreak—your body’s way of saying, *“This isn’t right, and I don’t know how to hold it.”*
- Trying to fix leads to disconnection, not closeness.
- You want her to move toward you, to help herself—and that longing feels nearly constant.

---

## 🔄 The Shift: From Savior to Companion
- A companion *feels without fleeing.*
- You can love without solving.
- New question: *Can I be with someone in pain without making it my job to fix them?*
- This shift honors your sensitivity *without overstepping your emotional boundaries.*

---

## 🌊 Naming the Fear
- “My fear is that my emotions will not have a place to go.”
- “I don’t know if I can find the flow.”
- Fear of not being able to express your own emotional truth.

---

## ✨ Emerging Beliefs
- “I know there is pain in her.”
- “I want to savor the disgust, to touch the tenderness under it.”
- “I want to explore being a companion.”
- “I love her—and saying that out loud feels vulnerable.”

---

## 🌱 Next Steps (Optional Prompts)
- Write a new internal agreement: *I offer presence, not solutions.*
- Practice sitting with your own feelings first before responding to hers.
- When the desire to “fix” arises, pause and ask: *What would a companion do here?*
