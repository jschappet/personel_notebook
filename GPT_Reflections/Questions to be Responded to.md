### **Philosophical Critique + Questions for You**

1. **Do “accept” and “take” still feel like part of the binary trap you’re naming?** Could “accept” be mistaken for passive compliance, if not paired with discernment?
    
2. **Is the compass metaphor your move beyond binaries like “accept/take,” “good/bad,” “right/wrong”?** How does the compass guide us when there’s no clear value judgment—only energetic direction?
    
3. **What is the epistemology of your compass?** In other words: _how does it know what direction is love or power?_ Is it somatic? Intuitive? Relational? This could be an edge worth sharpening.
    
4. **What do you think about the role of binaries in _language_ itself?** Are we ever fully outside the binary if our conceptual system is grounded in oppositions?
