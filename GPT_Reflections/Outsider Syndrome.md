### _Outsider Syndrome_

I just got home from work—March 15, 2019. Tomorrow, Tina is getting married. And it’s finally hitting me today. I’m not quite sure what exactly is landing, but it’s landing.

We’ve been divorced for 18 months. Am I questioning her decision? Yeah, I think she’s moving too fast. I’m not sure why she’s hurrying into another marriage. But honestly, that’s not really what my feelings are about.

I think it has more to do with being on the outside.

It’s the same feeling I have when Kate is off with her family. There are all these groups of people I know, and they all have someone. People they feel deeply close to. And here I am—alone.

I’ve asked myself before: _Will I ever find love?_ I don’t know if what I had with Tina was ever the kind of closeness I needed. And the same story repeated with Kate. We click in so many ways, and there’s this strong magnetic pull between us—but her focus shifts. And when it does, it shifts away from me.

I can live with that, sort of. But I haven’t figured out how to fill in the rest of my life without that person at the center.

Right now, my excuses are Audrey—because I come home to take care of her—or the commitment I’ve made to Kate. But beneath those reasons, I’m left feeling… isolated.

And that hurts. It makes me sad.

Sometimes I want to blame my parents. They were always working, and Patty and I were latchkey kids. But even then, I feel like I was alone more often than not. I don’t know where she would’ve been if we weren’t together. It’s all a bit blurry.

Today, I feel like I need to cry. Just sit and let it out. My therapist would ask: _What do the tears have to tell you?_

They say:  
I want to be held.  
I want to be loved.  
Find me.  
I’m here.  
Why don’t I fit in?

Is there such a thing as _outsider syndrome_? Like imposter syndrome, but instead of feeling fake, you feel like you're always on the outside looking in?

That’s how I feel.

Like everyone else has these deep, secure, loving connections.  
And I… don’t.
