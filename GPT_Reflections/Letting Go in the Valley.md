In August, I’ll be moving from Iowa City, Iowa to Portland, Oregon. I’ve never been to Portland, and I don’t know anyone who lives there. This is my first move as a digital nomad.

I’m following a pull I don’t fully understand yet—a longing not for happiness, but for contentment. I’ve been inspired by The Minimalists, Marie Kondo, and others who speak of the joy that comes from letting go. But I’ve also noticed something missing in those stories: the space in between. The valley between the initial excitement of freedom and the relief of unburdening. That’s the place I want to be honest about.

When I first dreamed of exploring the world, I felt a rush of energy. Possibility seemed endless. Do I stay in the U.S.? Go abroad? Find a tiny home, a mountain, a beach? The questions lit me up. But then I looked around my home. I saw the dog I’ve loved for 11 years, the antique furniture I’ve inherited, the family silver, the record collection I spent years building. I asked myself: _What am I going to do with all of this?_

This is the valley. This is the low that often gets skipped over.

I know that not everyone comes to nomadism by choice. For many, it’s forced—by war, poverty, rejection, or disaster. For them, the grief of letting go is visible and raw. But when I choose it, that grief can hide under the surface, disguised as logistics. I’ve learned that unprocessed feelings don’t go away. They just fester. So I’m sitting with them now.

As I write at my dining room table, I wonder: _Will I take this with me?_ The answer is clear—no. But how do I let it go? It’s a nice table. Maybe it’s worth something. But is it worth the effort of selling it, negotiating, coordinating pickups? That same question repeats with each item: photos, paintings, the motorcycle, old books, knickknacks. Maybe I should just store it all. After all, I won’t be a nomad forever… right?

And that’s where I pause. What am I holding onto? Why?

Marie Kondo asks, _Does it bring you joy?_ But for me, the deeper question is: _Am I afraid of letting this go?_ Yes. I’m afraid that someday I won’t just _want_ these things—I’ll _need_ them. That fear isn’t rational, but it’s real. And it deserves to be met with presence, not shame. So I ask myself: _What’s the worst-case scenario?_ I might miss something. I might regret letting it go. People might judge me. My family might say I don’t value what they value.

I might not fit in.

That’s the root. If I walk this path, I may no longer belong in the way I once did. Am I willing to accept that?

Yes.

I choose to move toward love—not the comfort of approval or the illusion of permanence, but the deeper love that asks me to live in alignment with my values. To trust the compass inside me. To be present with this moment, even when it’s messy or full of doubt.

So if you’re thinking of becoming a digital nomad, or moving across the country, or letting go of what no longer fits—pause for a while in the valley. Don’t rush to the next high. Sit with what arises. Let the grief and the wonder live side by side. That’s where discernment lives. That’s where the path forward becomes clear.
