I would like your help to start a community-inspired program on promoting joy in our everyday lives. This came off the back of conversations with a number of you in my everyday life in the community, whether that's around Evatt Shops or catching up with the locals along the path.

The ask? I'd like 4-5 family or group-houses volunteers to participate in the program. No money required. Just the activity of giving good will inside of your household. But everyone in the house would need to participate.

Here's the idea:

In our every day lives, the act of recognising moments of "joy" has become so under-valued that many of us struggle to see joy anymore or to properly stop and recognise a moment of gesture or good will. So the idea is to simply give "Joy" an intrinsic value in your household.

The program is yet to be fully developed, and I would like anyone's input that they'd like to share, but in essence it might work as follows:

1. Every month your household members are given a number of tokens. For arguments sake, and to avoid thinking of them as currency, let's call 
2. Every month your household members are given a number of tokens. For arguments sake, and to avoid thinking of them as currency, let's call them "Bubblegum" tokens.

3. ﻿﻿﻿Your Bubblegum expires at the end of the month.
4. ﻿﻿﻿You spend your Bubblegum when someone in your house does something that brings you joy. 
5. 

need to be classical - as in gifts - but it could be a funny joke, it could be a kind gesture, it could be an act of service - and it doesn't matter what it is, as long as it brought you joy.

1. ﻿﻿﻿You write down in a ledger (a piece of paper) the transaction, and the reason it brought you joy at the time that it happens. You gift that person your Bubblegum.
2. ﻿﻿﻿You can't spend Bubblegum on yourself. You can only spend it by gifting it to someone.
3. ﻿﻿﻿At the end of the month, you tally up the Bubblegum tokens in the house and whoever has the most gets what my family likes to call "A Yes Day" - and it's a day to celebrate that person, or people, that collected the most tokens. But your reward system might vary.
4. ﻿﻿﻿New month, everything resets and we start again.

Again, this is just the concept and anything is changeable, but l'm looking for 4-5 families or group houses that are interested in chatting about it first, agreeing on the model, and then simply giving it a go for a month or two and then reporting back.

If it goes well? Let's expand the concept to more households and let them experience/shape it. If it doesn't, nothing lost other than the explicit recognition of what joy has brought you in your household, or the joy you have brought others. Oh and a tiny bit of time writing something down.

So what do you think? Any volunteers to test this out
