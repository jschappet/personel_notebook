Hello @everyone,

@magic maker (Seth) and I have been making big progress with the Map we have been working on. At this point we need your help. Below are a few ways you could contribute to our map project:

- Open the [map](https://www.schappet.com/magic_map) review content
- Submit a new item to be added to the map [Form](https://www.schappet.com/m/start)
- Fork or clone the repository and explore it [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jschappet/magic_map_project)
- Request write access to the repository 
- Submit changes to the repository 

I hope you can find the level of effort here that is easy and simple for you. We need lots of help with content review. And I am especially terrible at making things look good, so any help you can offer there would also be appreciated. 

Thank you, Schappet
