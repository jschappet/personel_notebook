  

Weekly Writing Plan (Week 1)

Goal: Begin crafting the foundation of your future biography by grounding in why and where this story begins.

  

  

📝 Writing Assignments:

  

  

1. Opening Scene – “The Interview” (600–1000 words)

Prompt:

Imagine yourself being interviewed 3 years from now. Choose either Hot Ones or On Being.

  

- What’s the first question they ask you?
- How do you answer it?
- How does the energy in the room feel?
- Let your future self speak candidly, with the confidence of hindsight.

  

  

2. Compass Reflection – Symbolism and Use (400–800 words)

Prompt:

Explore what the Compass came to mean for you.

  

- How did it first appear?
- What does each direction symbolize (if relevant)?
- How did it guide your decisions, both internal and external?

  

  

  

  

  

🧠 Coaching Notes (Week 1)

  

  

Voice:

Don’t try to explain too much. Speak from the knowing place of your future self. Trust the reader to catch up.

  

Tone:

Let the tone shift between poetic, grounded, mythic, and practical. This isn’t a how-to—it’s a how-I.

  

Time Travel Trick:

Write in the past tense, but from the future. (“I didn’t know it at the time, but that moment in 2025 would be the first step toward the hill.”)
