### Food 

### Breakdown of Variables:

- **Cost per Person per Day** = average estimate based on meals (e.g., $10–$20 depending on simplicity or extravagance).
    
- **Number of People** = set as a variable (e.g., 10, 20, etc.).
    
- **Number of Days** = how long the retreat lasts.
    
- **Buffer** = 10–20% of total to cover unexpected needs, snacks, dietary options, etc.

Budget = ($15) × (20 people) × (3 days) + (15% buffer)
       = $900 + $135
       = $1,035
