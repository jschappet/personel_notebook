### 🎀 **Ribbon Types & Descriptions**

1. **Red Ribbon**  
    **Meaning:** _“I’m in a personal process / I’m not available for interaction.”_  
    **Purpose:** Signals that the person is **tending to themselves**, is in a **vulnerable or inward space**, or **not up for connection** at the moment. This sets a norm of **honoring someone’s need for space**.
    
2. **Yellow Ribbon**  
    **Meaning:** _“Approach gently.”_  
    **Purpose:** Indicates the person is **open to connection**, but wants others to check in more softly — an invitation to **tread mindfully** and **ask before diving deep**.
    
3. **Green Ribbon**  
    **Meaning:** _“I’m available and resourced.”_  
    **Purpose:** The person is open to **play, support, and relational engagement**. They're in a **grounded or outgoing state**, welcoming interaction.
