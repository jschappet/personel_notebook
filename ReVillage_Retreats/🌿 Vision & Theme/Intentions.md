Here are the listed intentions we plan to hold for the retreat

- Welcome everyone as if they were a happy puppy
	- caveats and boundaries to be explained

- **To create a sense of shared village life** — not just a workshop, but a lived experience of temporary community
    
- **To welcome and include all parts of people** — celebrating authenticity, edges, tenderness, and joy
    
- **To honor Christine and her space** — cultivating warmth, beauty, and mutual care
    
- **To be of service and feel supported** — balancing leadership and nourishment, not over-giving or burnout
    
- **To feel deeply connected to each other** — through touch, play, grief, and presence
    
- **To practice and deepen our relational art** — including Authentic Relating, ritual, and spontaneous magic
    
- **To make it easy to show up** — low-pressure, co-held, not overly structured
    
- **To reconnect with the land and each other** — spaciousness for nature, body, and breath
    
- **To live in the question of “What is enough?”** — doing less, being more
    
- **To allow the village to emerge** — through shared intention, play, responsibility, and care
