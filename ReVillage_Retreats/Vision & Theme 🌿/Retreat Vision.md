A weekend of presence, play, and possibility — where a small group of growth-minded, heart-centered people come together to co-create a field of welcome, truth, and delight.

This retreat is not about performance or self-improvement — it's about resting into ourselves, showing up as we are, and remembering what it’s like to feel fully received.

We’re dreaming of a **leader-full space**, where each person feels **supported, valued, and in service**. A place where **Genevieve can practice her art of space curation**, and where **each participant contributes to the collective experience** through authenticity, curiosity, and care.

It’s also a gift to Christine — a way of **activating her home with warmth, belonging, and intentional community** — fulfilling her wish to gather conscious, relational people in her space.
