### 📅 Action Items – **Next 1–2 Weeks**

    - Build a flow with 3 “things” per day (e.g., morning session, afternoon journaling, evening rest).
        
    - Incorporate breaks and slowness (like Deep Play structure).
        
2. **Develop sample reflection tools:**
    
    - Create 3–7 journaling stems or mirror reflection prompts.
        
    - Try both a daily repeatable version and unique daily ones.
        
3. **Develop structure for collaborative food roles:**
    
    - Define roles: head chef and sub-chefs for each meal.
        
    - Include emotional check-ins for chefs (e.g., birthday circle before cooking).
        
4. **Create ritual templates:**
    
    - Ritual for naming roles (“I am the listener right now”).
        
    - Ritual for shared selection (e.g., people vote for what they want to lead/attend).
        
5. **Begin outlining psychodrama session(s):**
    
    - Write up a detailed plan for the “parts of the brain” psychodrama activity.

### 🎉 Action Items – **At the Event**

1. **Host opening ritual:**
    
    - Use a mirror, journal, or prompt to check in with self.
        
    - Set tone of container with agreement language and feelings welcome.
        
2. **Facilitate role-check-ins:**
    
    - Before transitions (e.g., meals, cleaning), use mini birthday circles to check in with people taking lead roles.
        
3. **Use ritual voting process for participant-led sessions:**
    
    - Circle sharing of what participants want to offer → embodied voting via walking over to choices.
        
4. **Embed psychodrama organically into the day:**
    
    - Invite support or inner role exploration during transitions or overwhelm.
        
    - Allow space for “psychodrama on the go” as well as one extended afternoon session.
        
5. **Hold space for co-creation of rest/integration:**
    
    - Encourage agreements like “putting feet in the stream” or solo forest time with check-in on return.
