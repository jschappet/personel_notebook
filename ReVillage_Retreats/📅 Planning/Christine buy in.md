Christine, we’ve been looking closely at what needs to be true for a visit to Phoenix to feel like a full yes — especially for me (Schappet). I want to feel supported, valued, leader-full, and in service. Genevieve wants to feel respected, valued, and to practice and experience her art of curating relational/depth context.

I would like to explore together if this visit is an opportunity for us (Schappet, Genevieve, and Christine) to create a retreat event. Do we have an alignment of shared values and vision? I heard you say you long for more connection and to fill your home with heart-centered, authentic people. Would you like to explore our values and vision together to see if it is a match?

We’d love to co-create this with you, not ask you to carry it. Our intention would be for you to feel honored, cherished, and deeply supported in this experience — we can do this with clear roles, shared responsibilities, and a spirit of collaboration. Can you think of anything else it needs?

If this resonates, can we meet up just to talk about values and alignment? 

Yay! This is a first step.  And if the conversation does not end with a retreat happening right now, I will still see it as a success because we started the conversation.

ps.

Chat AI was feeling helpful and brainstormed a whole bunch of other things we can talk about when alignment is found. 

- Define roles: Facility Host, Kitchen Leader, Clean-Up Leader, MC/Greeter, Advertising/Marketing/enrollment - just brainstorming here.
    
- Create role descriptions with responsibilities and resource needs
    
- Draft rough retreat schedule (Friday–Sunday)
    
- Identify a simple but central theme
    
- Plan outreach: who to invite and how to frame it
    
- Consider budget and potential costs/donations
    
- Begin developing supply checklist
