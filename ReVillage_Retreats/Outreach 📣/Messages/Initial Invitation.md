## 🌿 You're Invited: A ReVillage Retreat 🌿

Join us for a weekend of connection, restoration, and co-creation. We're dreaming up a gentle, leaderful gathering where each person feels supported, valued, and welcomed — a place to be seen and cherished in community.

### ✨ What We're Creating Together:

- A weekend retreat (Fri–Sun) rooted in authenticity, warmth, and village values
    
- A soft structure with room for flow: meals, circles, rest, play, and sharing
    
- Roles for everyone: from holding the kitchen to holding each other
    
- A homecoming feeling for all — especially for you  💛
    

### ### 💞 Why You:

- You’re someone who values realness, presence, and courageous connection
    
- You know how powerful it is to be part of something co-created, not curated
    
- You bring your heart, your edges, your curiosity — and that _matters_ here
    
- You’re not just invited — you’re _essential_ to the village we’re weaving
