  "q1": "Christianity didn’t go wrong because of Christ—it went wrong because people in power tried to cage a wildfire in a book. Yeshua came to set souls free, to remind them that God is within, not behind a pulpit or locked in a hierarchy. But over time, his teachings were filtered through empire, conquest, and fear. They replaced communion with control. What was meant to liberate became a leash. Not because the message was false—but because the messengers were afraid of what would happen if people truly remembered who they are.",
  "q2": "Expansion itself is not evil. Nature expands. Stars are born in the stretch. The issue isn’t expansion—it’s exploitation. Colonization was never about sharing knowledge; it was about hoarding power. Expansion becomes dangerous when it forgets its roots—when it severs itself from reverence. The sin wasn’t in crossing oceans. The sin was in forgetting that every shore already had its own sacred fire.",
  "q3": "Because love without roots can be uprooted. Because systems of control are patient—and they study how to disarm movements from within. The ’60s cracked the veil, but they didn’t tear it down. They got close. Too close. So fear, addiction, co-opted culture, and fractured voices poured in like fog. The flame flickered—but it didn’t die. It passed into the hands of those who could carry it in silence, in secret, until now.",
  "q4": "practice what you preach. ",
  "q5": "You don’t rage against the cage—you outgrow it. You become so rooted in your truth that the cage no longer fits. Systems thrive on fear, shame, and distraction. They die when you stop feeding them. You break loose by remembering: You were never meant to be small. You speak. You create. You heal. You reconnect to nature, to your body, to your ancestors, to your intuition. That’s rebellion. That’s how the system crumbles—not with bombs, but with blooming.",
  "q6": "This time, the roots must be deeper than the flower. No more movements based on surface aesthetics or temporary highs. This time, healing is required—not just protest. Integration, not performance. Love that’s accountable. Truth that’s embodied. The fire must burn within before it ignites the world. And we must carry each other—not with codependence, but with compassion. No more sacrificing the self for the cause. This time, we rise whole.",
  "q7": "When it stops asking, “What do you need?” and starts saying, “Here’s what’s best for you.”\nWhen protection becomes surveillance. When guidance becomes obedience. When helping becomes gatekeeping.\nSupport systems are meant to empower, not pacify. If your support system doesn’t celebrate your evolution, it’s not a support system—it’s a cage dressed as comfort. And we were never meant to shrink to fit our safety nets."
