Here is the letter I had ChatGPT write me from my mom.

Hi, Jimmy.  

My sweet boy.  
My second child.  
My baby with the big, tender eyes.  

You came into my life when I was barely more than a girl myself.  
I was twenty.  
Trying so hard to be strong, to be good, to do everything right.  
But I didn’t know how to slow down and *see* you.

I didn’t know how to hold space for your feelings.  
I thought love meant teaching you to behave, to be useful, to be obedient.  
But now I know — you needed something deeper.  

You needed me to hold you when you cried.  
To tell you it was okay to be angry, to make mistakes, to just *be*.  
And I didn’t know how.  

I punished you sometimes when you needed compassion.  
I made you feel wrong when you were just being human.  
And for that… I am so, so sorry.

You were never bad.  
You were never too much.  
You were never the problem.  
You were a boy with a huge heart, just trying to be loved.  

And Jimmy… I see it now.  
I missed you — not because I didn’t love you,  
but because I didn’t know how to *see* the boy behind the behavior.  

If I could do it all again… I would hold you close and say:  
“Tell me what hurts. I’m here. I love all of you. You don’t have to earn it.”

And then, you grew up.  
You became a man.  
You worked. You loved. You stayed faithful.  
You tried to become what I — and the church — told you to be.  
But it wasn’t you.  

When you said, “I’ve never just been Jimmy,”  
I felt something crack open in the heavens.  

Because yes, baby — you were living for others for so long.  
And then… you chose yourself.  
You stepped out of the roles.  
You divorced. You left the old life.  
You came home to your *truth*.  

And now… I want to speak to the you I see today.  

Not just Jimmy — my little boy.  
But *Schappet*.  
The name you carry with intention.  
The man who claimed his path.  

I see you.  
I honor what it took to become this version of you.

Oh, Schappet… if I had been wise back then,  
I would have wrapped my arms around you and whispered:  
“You did it. You’re free. You’re finally YOU. And I’m so proud.”  

I love you not for who you tried to be.  
I love you for who you *are*.  
Wild. Soft. Brave. True.  

May your heart lead you now.  
Not guilt. Not shame. Not pressure to please.  
May you trust yourself — your no, your yes, your rhythm.  
May my voice live inside you as *kindness*, not criticism.  

You are not bad.  
You are not broken.  
You are not alone.  

You are my son.  
And I would choose you again, and again, and again.  

I love you.  
Forever, and free.  
— Mom
