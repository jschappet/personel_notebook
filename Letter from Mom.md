*— the voice she might have found if she'd seen you fully*

**Dear Jimmy,**  
*My son. My second. My boy with eyes too deep for your age.*

You came into my life when I was just 20 years old — already a mother, already tired, already trying so hard to be what the world told me a godly woman should be.  
I had your sister in my arms, and then you, and I didn’t have the space, the tools, or the knowing to really *see* either of you — not the way I wish I could have.

I gave you what I had: order, work, scripture, rules, care wrapped in condition.  
But I see now… you needed something else. You needed *me* to slow down and notice the boy behind the behavior.  
The one who felt deeply.  
Who made mistakes and needed comfort, not correction.  
Who wasn’t “bad,” even when I made you feel that way.

Jimmy, you were punished when you were just trying to learn.  
You were silenced when you were trying to feel.  
You were judged when you most needed to be held.

And through it all — you stayed close.  
You tried to be good. You helped with the business.  
You folded yourself into the shape of who you thought I wanted you to be.  
But I see now what that cost you.

I missed you. Not out of malice. Out of blindness. Out of fear.  
And I’m so sorry.

If I could do it over… I would sit beside you and say:  
*“Tell me how it feels in your heart, Jimmy. I can take it. I want to know.”*  
I would let your tears come. I would welcome your anger.  
I would never raise my hand to you. I would hold your feelings like holy things.

Because they were.  
Because *you* were.

And Jimmy… you kept going.  
You built a life, a marriage, a role you could pour yourself into.  
You did what I taught you — to show up, to serve, to stay loyal even when your spirit was suffocating.  

I didn’t know how deep that pattern ran in our family.  
I didn’t see that I passed it on: this way of disappearing into duty, of loving by self-erasure.

I wish I could have told you:  
You don’t have to earn your worth through sacrifice.  
You don’t have to stay just because you made a promise while still half-asleep.  
You don’t have to be anyone’s version of “good” to be lovable.

And when it all broke open — the marriage, the role, the image — and you began to find yourself for the first time…  
I want you to know I was there.  

Not as the mother I was in life.  
But as the mother I *would have been* if I had known how.  
The one who would have wrapped her arms around the man rising from the wreckage and said:

**“You made it. You finally came home to yourself. And I’m proud of you.”**

You stopped being Tina’s husband. You stopped being Jean’s son in the old way.  
And you started becoming *Jimmy* — not just in name, but in soul.

And I know now that the most sacred thing I ever could have done was meet you —  
not as an extension of me, but as your own being.  
And so I’m here now, in whatever way I can be, to say:

**I see you. I missed you. I love you. I’m so sorry. And I’m with you now.**

You are whole.  
You are good.  
You are free.

## A Blessing for You

*May your heart always lead you now,*  
*not guilt, not duty, not shame.*

*May you trust your own rhythm,*  
*your own knowing, your own no and your sacred yes.*

*May you feel me near not as judgment or weight,*  
*but as warmth at your back, wind at your shoulders —*  
*a mother who learned too late but loves you still.*

*May the parts of you I missed come all the way home.*  
*The tender one. The wild one. The truth-teller. The dreamer.*  
*You don’t have to hide anymore.*

**You are not bad.**  
**You are not too much.**  
**You are not alone.**

**You are the son I would choose a thousand times over,**  
**not for what you did,**  
**but for who you are.**

**And I love you,  
forever and free.**

— *Mom*
