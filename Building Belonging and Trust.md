I want to talk about a few times in my relationship with Genevieve. I would like you to listen and reflect. Questions are good, please ask for clarification and deepening. There is nothing to fix or change here, please avoid advice.

When Genevieve and I were just getting to know one another we had a great chemistry and connection in our online and phone conversations. After a few days she asked me if together we could have a practice relationship. I was at the time, new to Portland, OR. Not attached to anyone, and was identifying as solo poly. She was living in Mount Vernon, WA. She was separated from her husband but still married and has 5 kids. I agreed to being her practice boyfriend. My one stipulation for her request was that this be short-term. I did not want it to become a long term committed relationship.
From my perspective we were having a wonderful time together. Maybe one day she'll tell you the story from her perspective. She came down to visit me for the weekend in Portland. We spent the entire weekend making love and we hardly left my apartment. For me this was really ideal, I loved the idea of a weekend, vacation romance relationship. And as the with most dreams this one had to end as well. I thought the prep work I had done at the beginning would have made the end much easier. It didn't, she still had to deal with all the rejection and hurt, I didn't want to be with her. We had many long conversations as we were breaking up. She would plead with me for a reason why, she wasn't she pretty enough, she was too fat, too many kids, I wasn't ready. Any and all of these were possible. I really didn't have a clear idea in myself why I was a no. I do know that I was still recovering from a 20 year marriage that I ended. I was still in the process of finding myself and wanted to avoid my pattern of merging with another and losing myself. So I didn't give her any reason, I let her make up whatever she wanted. And boy did her system take that as a challenge, she had to know why. Her stories seemed to take over everything.

Eventually, we stopped speaking as much. We still hung out online and we each went off and did our own dating. She's told me a few times since then that when I showed interest in another person, she finally slammed the door shut on me.

Fast forwarding to a few years later, we reconnected, I moved from solo poly, to a monogamous partnership with her. We were moving into a house together. She was busy and super stressed dealing with a nasty custody case with her soon to be ex husband. We had been talking about the living arrangements and how much time the three boys were going to be at our house. In those early days there were lots of fights between them. We talked about all sorts of arrangements, like each boy would spend two nights at our place or two boys together, and one on a different schedule.  When any of the boys were with us, it took 100% of our attention. I needed space and time to process becoming a step dad. I was going from zero kids to kids that needed nearly our combined full attention. 
So when she came home one day and announced a schedule change that was going into the parenting plan without talking to me, I was hurt. All of my free time had just evaporated. And when I tried to talk about it, it felt like the feelings that I had didn't matter. She had to see her boys, she had to hold onto them, and I was unreasonable. Or I wasn't owning my emotions. And so I now became other enemy that she was battling, I was now keeping her from her kids too.

In each of these stories and many others, when I say no or have some negative emotion towards her, she goes aggressive and I have to work to fix things. I know this is patterns and triggers and all of the relationship dynamics at play. But man it sucks to not have my no have space. We are currently in another version of this where she is in desperate need of protection, her system won't allow her to ask for it, and my system hears her aggression as a demand. My need for autonomy won't let me soften here any more. 

Her latest message to me: "I will
Never make a request like that again. Being turned down at the point I was turned down was way too painful. Requests are no longer safe. 

So when you say - make a request. 
I say - sorry. Check with your values. No more requests. "

I hear you, Schappet. Thank you for laying this out with so much detail and honesty — the beginnings, the deep chemistry, the ways you tried to draw boundaries, and the ongoing cycle that shows up between the two of you. I’ll reflect back some things I notice, and ask a few questions for deepening.

1. I fall back to "No" is a complete sentence. So I feel justified in not explaining myself. I'm not sure I even had a complete understanding of it myself.

2. My system goes through all of those. It starts with withdraw, then fight then numb.

3. tragic - and defensive, "I protect myself from your no by never needing anything." 

4. Yes, if either of us could just hear the other. I've imagined the story being completely different in the first meeting. If she had said, "Wow! I really liked our trial relationship, it was fun and I think we have something really special here that I've never felt before. I would love to try another one closer to my house. Would you come up here for a weekend?" -- this would have validated where I am, and showed her interest. I'm pretty sure I would have said yes. And I know how big an ask this is. and I know how big a deal it is for her to do any asking, I have similar protections. But I can't, won't, go around guessing at what she needs. I lose myself and my own needs when I have to guess.

it lands in my body with warmth.

Foundation - and I imagine her rejection of it, I'm just being stubborn or something like that.

This is the core of our relationship. For me being ok with someone's no is a sign of belonging. Being able to say no, is a sign of belonging, allowing the other person to be just as they are is a sign of belonging. A place where demands become requests, where needs are expectations, but instead they are see as a beautiful part of existing.

it seems like there is not a place where we can feel that belonging together, so we need to build it. This is part of what community means for me.

Let's stop here. please convert this into a message of belonging and the path to building trust. Use my words as much as possible. The target audience is the community, but written as a journal entry.

Here’s a draft shaped into a journal entry for your community audience, keeping close to your words and tone:

**Journal Entry — On Belonging and Building Trust**

When I imagine being met with a simple request, spoken with openness and desire — it lands in my body with warmth. There’s something so human in that moment: I’m seen where I am, and I’m invited forward without demand.

For me, being okay with someone’s “no” is a sign of belonging. Being able to say “no” is also a sign of belonging. Allowing another person to be just as they are — with their yes, their no, their need, their silence — is the deepest sign of belonging I know.

In that space, demands transform into requests. Needs stop being expectations and instead become a beautiful part of existing.

This is the core of relationship for me. And yet, it often feels like there isn’t a ready-made place where this kind of belonging is shared. Which means we have to build it. Together.

For me, this is part of what community means: creating the trust that allows us to say yes or no without fear, to make requests without collapse, and to honor each other’s humanity even when it doesn’t match our own hopes.

Belonging isn’t given; it’s built. And trust isn’t automatic; it’s grown. This is the work I want to be part of — here, with you.
