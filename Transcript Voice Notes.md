So we're gonna start playing tomorrow of course we'll start with our arriving and welcoming. What do we think would be a good arriving? I'm not Maybe we could I'm not ready to.  Okay, let me offer something and you can ponder it. We seed. Maybe sentenced.  An introductory question to the if you're just chatting with somebody, start with... Yeah, a sentence stem there, but like a question. I like the one that you're friend had from..  The reunion. It was like, um. relationship kids.. And you and, um.  I don't I feel. That one's a little hard because it's, so informational. So we can build in informational..  Like, we could build a hole games around different levels. And I don't think that's what we're. I think tomorrow we're kind of thinking about playing.  Okay, well, anyway, so we can put the the arriving on hold. I do want to get to the two games that we said, which were the mirroring game and the lens of attention. Okay, I'm also thinking that the Der game...  Ooh, Always a favorite with me. I really want to introduce it with the amped up. Like, you really get to ooze and Oz when you hear the answers.  You, but I don't want it to be like, performatory, so I want it to be more, like. I mean, yes, but like, when you describe it, you're like "Y,'ciety." And I'm like, ", I take a step back."  Like, "Let's just imagine what it's like...to... All right, I'll keep you're the guru. I'll keep my excitement in check tomorrow.  You can keep your excitement to yourself. Like, I love this game. It's so fun for me.  That's fine. But. pushing it out on. Ooh, hot, that's those performative sounds..  Okay, um.. So we probably need just one more game to fill out the.. Oh, I think we need sentence them that support the transitions to mainly.  I don't know that we need another game, but let's see. So, yeah, because the guru game, if everyone goes, that could take 40 minutes. Mm hmm.  So. But I think the goo game is an end game for newbies. Like, uh, it's something you got to warm up to being able to do.  And could I mean, like, even giving permission, like, if you're uncomfortable as a guru, if you're welcome to, you know, to show a little, or just say, you know, it's it's you that knows the answer. Yeah, like encourage. Yeah, okay. kind of reflect back encouragement as a..  Yeah, so we need to check in, I think, three or four sentence stems could be a good check in. Mmm. It's just how it, you know, one thing I'm feeling right now, one thing I don't want to share right now.  Whoa, what if one thing I don't want to share right now because. We can never tell if that's super challenging for people that would be embarrassed, or if it's actually kind of exciting and fun. I think it's a bit revealing, 'cause you're...  It is. I guess we could model.. whatever version, like, bit. Okay.  'Cause I like the the second stage of the sentence stem gets.. For me, it like, amps up the creativity of just a step more and like, pushes. The because?  Well, any sort of two parts like that. Okay. Did you sentence stems and then I guess lens of attention, and then movement, and then break, and then sentence stem, leading to guru game.  Yeah, okay. Leading to integration. Yeah.  Done. So here's to do list for the Chat EPT generates some sentence stems that will fit with the themes for the mirroring game, the guru game, and the lens of attention. So maybe some sentence stems around attention around knowing and Yeah, deep knowing, like, if I didn't have any limitations, I would say I would.  This is how I'd change the world. Or.. If I were a genie granting wishes...  This is one wish that I would grant right now to myself. Or if I ran into a genie in the forest. Yeah.  He said I had to be selfish right now and have something like grant myself something delicious. What would it be? That sounds fun.  Okay, I'm gonna close this out for now and enjoy the view.
