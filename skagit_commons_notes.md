# Skagit Commons Vision Notes
*Updated: 2025-09-10*

## Core Idea
Transform Skagit County into a living commons—a cooperative system where residents share in the wealth of land, water, and labor. Ownership shifts into stewardship, with all imports/exports and resource flows tokenized into a shared economy. Every resident holds a stake, and the floor of housing, food, and dignity rises with the county’s prosperity.

## Guiding Principles
- **Stewardship over Ownership:** Land, water, and resources belong to the commons; residents are stewards, not owners.  
- **Floor First:** Surplus resources first raise the baseline for housing, food, and care.  
- **No Discussion Without Representation:** Every resident has a seat through local assemblies or circles.  
- **Non-Hierarchical Governance:** Consent-based, circle-structured, rotating roles.  
- **Transparency:** Open budgets, rotating citizen audits, visible decision processes.  
- **Cultural Flourishing:** Rituals, folklore, and storytelling sustain belonging and reciprocity.

## Early Adopter Groups in Skagit
1. **Young Families in Mount Vernon, Burlington, Sedro-Woolley**  
   - Struggling with housing and costs.  
   - Want security and belonging.  

2. **Farmers & Land Stewards**  
   - Facing succession challenges and developer pressure.  
   - Want legacy, dignity, and continuity.  

3. **Middle-Class Workers (Teachers, Nurses, Trades, County Staff)**  
   - Burned out, underpaid, essential.  
   - Want stability and recognition.  

4. **Cultural & Spiritual Progressives (Anacortes, Bow/Edison, arts & eco-villagers)**  
   - Already experimenting with intentionality, permaculture, AR, ritual.  
   - Want infrastructure and scale.  

---

## Governance Model
- **Neighborhood Assemblies:** Each town/neighborhood has a circle.  
- **Sector Councils:** Farming, fisheries, trades, healthcare, education.  
- **Commons Assembly:** Rotating cross-section of residents synthesizing decisions.  
- **Grief & Story Councils:** Hold space for ritual, conflict resolution, folklore.  
- **Decision-Making:** Sociocracy/consent rather than majority vote.  

---

## Onboarding & Offboarding
- **Onboarding:** Every resident receives a token stake with voting rights, responsibilities, and access to commons.  
- **Offboarding:** No penalty for leaving; exiting residents receive 3–6 months equivalent of living expenses.  
- **Housing:** Floor housing allocated by lottery as units become available.  

---

## Economic Design
- **Token System:** Represents both stake in commons and means of exchange for engagement.  
- **Floor Guarantee:** Every resident guaranteed housing, food allowance, utilities, and small stipend.  
- **Engagement Rewards:** Tokens earned for participation in events, community service, governance.  
- **Resource Pooling:** Farms, fisheries, and businesses feed surplus into commons economy.  
- **Corporate Transition:** Local businesses encouraged to convert to co-op or trust model.  

---

## Culture & Folklore
- **Weekly Grief Ritual:** Normalizes shared mourning, deepens belonging.  
- **Commons Folklore System:** Stories of reciprocity, honest work, stewardship, resisting free-riding.  
- **Celebrations:** Harvest festivals, river ceremonies, storytelling nights.  
- **New Myths:** Skagit as “The County That Became a Village.”

## Strategic Milestones
1. **Vision Building (Now):** Share idea, develop emotional and rational pitch.  
2. **Pilot Housing (Target: 250 homes):** Sponsored by farms & land trusts to demonstrate floor-first model.  
3. **Commons Charter:** Draft non-hierarchical governance constitution.  
4. **Adoption Curve:** Begin with families, farmers, workers, cultural leaders; expand outward.  
5. **Cultural Anchors:** Weekly rituals, shared stories, early token economy practices.

## Pitches
- **Farmers:** Secure legacy, ensure labor peace, protect family for 2–3 generations.  
- **Land Trusts:** Expand mission of preservation into community stewardship.  
- **Families:** Housing and food security, future for children.  
- **Workers:** Stability, dignity, access to community.  
- **Progressives:** Realize eco-village dreams at scale.  
- **Capitalists:** Higher productivity, fewer social costs, long-term profit stability.  

---

## Risks & Challenges
- **Free Riders:** Mitigated by guaranteed floor plus engagement-based rewards.  
- **Corporate Resistance:** Transition plan for local businesses.  
- **Partisan Resistance:** Bridge-building narratives; focus on family, land, and legacy.  
- **Complexity of Governance:** Education and cultural storytelling key to sustaining engagement.
