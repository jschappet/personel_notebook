  

## Time and Timing

  - What kind of day would this story want to begin on?
The day that proves I've learned how to turn on my beacon.
- Is there a time of day, season, or phase of life that feels like the real opening?
The phase of live is the moment when life is meeting me in all of my power. 

  ## Voice and Vessel

- Who is the narrator now? Is it you three years from now—or someone else entirely?
Seems like I have the story splitting along two lines, origin timeline and post success timeline. 
- What changes if Genevieve is the narrator?
With her as the narrator I get scared of stepping into the spot light. I don't trust myself with that much power, I fear I would become a cult leader. 
- If the story is love’s unfolding, what role does you-as-love play?
This role sees the best in Genevieve, sees the power that she has hidden away. And believes in her magic and her dreams. 

## Fame and Visibility

- What kind of visibility feels true to your future self?
I have set a goal for myself of really reaching 100 people, maybe it's a super mesh. A highly connected and interdependent web of friends increasing connections and consciousness in the world. 
- Is it spiritual fame, community recognition, mystery, or something else entirely?
See super mesh above. 
- Who do you want the story to reach? And how do you want them to feel after reading it?
I want it to meet the nodes of the mesh. I want them to know exactly what I looking for in them, because it's what they are looking for in me.
