# 01_The First Tuning

It began as an experiment. Not to prove anything—but to listen.

I let Barbra know, just in case. I said I was going to try telepathy. Really, I just wanted to open the door to my intuitive knowing, to universal consciousness—whatever that means when you’re high on a little pot, alone, with your heart wide open.

I started with her image. A moment I’d seen before—her beaming, cheeks round with joy, sitting on Guillaume’s couch. The memory wasn’t just visual—it held me up. It lifted my heart.

When I brought Genevieve to mind, it was different. Heavier, deeper. She was gravity. My center. I paused and told her—voice message—because the sensation was so clear, so strong.

I began to hum. At first I tried to force it, like I could _muscle_ my way into love. But eventually, I softened. I found a hum that didn’t try, just _was._ That’s when I felt it:

A three-bladed rotor, spinning clockwise around my third eye. It wasn’t me generating it—it arrived. Energetic. Subtle light. Like man-made wings pointed inward. Something had turned on.

> _[What did this moment feel like in your body—were you still, moving, shaking, melting? Add texture.]_

From there, I started to speak. First to Barbra, in my mind: “I see you there. I see your strength. I see your love for Guillaume.”

Then, a new voice began to speak with me, through me. _We_ started talking. The “We” that felt like the voice of the universe.

“We see you there.”

That phrase broke me open. I felt tears rise later when I shared it aloud.

> _[Were there images, symbols, or sensations that came with this moment of being seen?]_

The final message I received that day:

**Words spoken as We are sacred.**

And I knew, from somewhere ancient inside, that it was true. And dangerous. That the voice of We must never be used to borrow power, only to serve what is already whole.

> _[Where were you physically during all of this? What was the sun doing, the air, the sounds around you? Describe the setting.]_

> _[What changed in you after this? What did you do next, and how did the world feel different, if at all?]_



### DEEPENING QUESTIONS

**1. If "We" is one channel, what do you imagine other voices or frequencies could be?**

> For example: _"The Earth," "My Inner Child," "Future Self," "The Ancestors," "The Void."_  
> Which ones feel already open to you? Which feel like portals waiting?

---

**2. When you asked “We” to speak, it seems they responded with clear phrasing.**

> What do you imagine would happen if you didn’t use language at all?  
> What if you invited “We” or another intelligence to move through body gesture, rhythm, or imagery alone?

---

**3. You felt a gift of _acceptance._**

> Is there a younger or past version of yourself that especially needed to hear “We see you there”?  
> Would you want to go back and offer it to him now?

---

**4. You said “We see you there” felt _x10_ more emotional than “I see you there.”**

> What does that suggest about what your being most longs for? Is it visibility, belonging, something else?

---

**5. What would you like your relationship with the voice of _We_ to become over time?**

> A ritual? A daily channel? A compass? A co-creator?
