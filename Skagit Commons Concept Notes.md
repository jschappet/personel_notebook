## Vision Overview
Skagit Commons imagines a county where prosperity, care, and belonging are shared. No one falls below a basic standard of housing, food, and dignity, while participation in community and stewardship of resources amplifies opportunity for everyone.

## Core Principles

### 1. Floor-First Priority
- Everyone in Skagit guaranteed:  
  - Safe housing with utilities  
  - Sufficient food for nutrition  
  - Modest stipend for living essentials
- The floor rises as the county prospers. Luxury for some becomes standard for all.
- Floor applies to onboarding, ongoing life, and offboarding: leaving residents take 3–6 months of floor-level living support.

### 2. Stewardship Over Ownership
- Land, water, and natural resources belong to the commons.  
- Families, farmers, and residents are stewards, not owners.  
- Responsibilities include food production, ecological care, housing maintenance, and community participation.

### 3. Participation is Rewarded
- Residents earn **tokens** for:  
  - Attending assemblies, events, cultural activities  
  - Contributing labor or stewardship work  
  - Community facilitation and resource management
- Tokens grant:  
  - Voice in governance  
  - Access to decision-making processes  
  - Expanded access to resources beyond the floor

### 4. Freedom of Movement
- No penalty for leaving.  
- Offboarding: 3–6 months of living expenses provided.  
- Onboarding: lottery for floor-level housing; access to food and stipend immediately.  
- Tokens activate after initial residency period (e.g., 6–12 months) to prevent gaming the system.

### 5. Generational Security
- Founding farm families or major contributors guaranteed support for 2–3 generations.  
- Floor + dividend guarantees, not outsized economic stakes.  
- Recognized as “Founding Families” or “First Stewards” for ceremonial or narrative purposes.

### 6. Shared Economic Model
- County resources pooled: farms, fisheries, forestry, energy, and trade.  
- Profits flow first to raising the floor.  
- Beyond floor: surplus distributed through token engagement system.  
- Natural resource wealth stays in-county, countering extractive models.

### 7. Cultural and Social Design
- No discussion without representation; all residents have a voice.  
- Governance layered: neighborhood → council → county assembly.  
- Transparency via open ledgers of resource use and decisions.  
- Incentives for community engagement: paying residents to attend events, workshops, councils, etc.

## Target Stakeholders
- **Farm Owners**
  - Labor security via resident workforce.  
  - Generational care guarantees.  
  - Legacy and stewardship recognition.  
- **Residents**
  - Security and dignity via the floor.  
  - Opportunity to participate and earn tokens.  
- **New Arrivals / Seasonal Workers**
  - Fair lottery for housing.  
  - Engagement opportunities to earn tokens.  
  - Pathway into stable, community-rooted life.

## Onboarding / Offboarding Principles
- **Onboarding**
  - Floor housing lottery if units are limited.  
  - Immediate food and stipend access.  
  - Token eligibility after residency commitment (6–12 months).  
- **Offboarding**
  - Floor travels with residents leaving: 3–6 months of expenses.  
  - Minimum residency period required before offboarding benefits.

## Pitfalls & Considerations
- **Free riders:** floor system prevents destitution; tokens reward engagement.  
- **Decision fatigue:** layered governance and rotating facilitation.  
- **Churn:** residency requirement + cooldown period.  
- **Housing scarcity:** build out floor housing first.  
- **Cultural resistance:** stewardship narrative; floor-first guarantees; founder recognition instead of sweetheart deals.  
- **Token inflation:** cap token distribution per person per month.

## Messaging & Storytelling

### Vision Statement
*In Skagit, no one falls. Every person has secure housing, enough food, and the dignity of belonging. Land and resources are cared for together. Participation is rewarded. Freedom and mobility are guaranteed. Generational care honors those who build the commons. Wealth and legacy are shared. Skagit is a living, breathing commons, and every resident is at its heart.*

### Emotional Pitch (Short)
*Imagine a county where no one falls, where every person has a safe home, enough food, and the dignity of belonging. Our land, water, and resources are cared for by all of us, not hoarded by a few. Families, farmers, workers, newcomers—all share in the county’s prosperity, and every hand that tends the land strengthens the whole. Those who leave carry the floor with them; those who arrive are welcomed into the heart of the community. In Skagit, our wealth is shared, our legacy is rooted, and our lives are intertwined in a living, breathing commons.*

### Spoken Pitch (~90 seconds)
*“I want you to imagine Skagit County—not just as a place where we live, but as a place that belongs to all of us, together. A county where no one falls, where every person has a safe home, enough food, and the dignity of belonging.  

Here, our land, water, and resources aren’t hoarded—they’re cared for. Families, farmers, workers, newcomers—every hand that tends the land strengthens the whole. Showing up matters. Your presence, your care, your time—they all contribute, and they’re honored.  

If someone leaves, the county doesn’t punish them—they take the floor with them, a bridge to safety and mobility. And when someone arrives, they’re welcomed, given a voice, and invited to share in the prosperity we build together.  

This is more than a system. It’s a living, breathing commons. It’s a Skagit where wealth is shared, where legacy is rooted, and where every life is intertwined with the land and with each other.”*

## Next Steps / Future Work
- Develop visual model of resource → floor → participation → surplus → floor cycle.  
- Map out early pilot: starter farms, community engagement, token economy simulation.  
- Build storytelling materials for farmers, residents, and local officials.  
- Explore legal, financial, and governance frameworks to enable a county-wide commons.  
- Refine token design: governance, participation, economic distribution, anti-speculation features.
