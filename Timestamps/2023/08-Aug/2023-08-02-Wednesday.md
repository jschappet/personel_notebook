Picked up Eric and Quinton today, we had a few minor issues through the day, but they were resolved peacefully.   Late in the evening while on our walk the boys had fallen behind because they were throwing rocks at each others legs.   During their game, Eric threw a rock and at the same time Quinton bent over to grab a rock and was hit on the head. He had some bleeding from the rock.
