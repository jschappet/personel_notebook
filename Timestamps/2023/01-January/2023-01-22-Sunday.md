Walking back into the Rv this evening I told Quinton and Eric that there would be no cinnamon rolls if there was any fighting in the Rv. As done as we walked in Quinton pushed Eric. I told them No cinnamon rolls because of this attack, there is a zero tolerance policy. Quinton began hitting me, as I continued to tall him no. When I turned my back he kicked me. I picked him up, and put him on the floor. He then proceeded to bite my arm. See the photo below.
