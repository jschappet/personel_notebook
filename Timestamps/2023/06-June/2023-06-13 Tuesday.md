I found what may be a usefull metaphore the other day. If wa imagine that our Energetic Bodies are like trees. We are planted & transplanted near other trees or far from other trees. Some may stand alone in a field & be fully satisfied other would fall if standing alone like that.

Relationships happen when m roots & branches start touching your roots and branches.

As we grow we each expand taking more space, this meansthat out branches & roots get more and more entagnled with the others. Growing together is painful. We are constantly pushing the other person's branches aside to make room for our own.

In this metaphor branches are conscious growth, and roots are unconscious growth.

As careful as we may be, because we are so close to one another ther are going to be times when of of my branches hits one of yours.

This lesson is everywhere in the woods.
