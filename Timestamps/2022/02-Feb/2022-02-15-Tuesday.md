Hiding from time Exploring wonder  With one curious mind  Forget all you know  From those who preach Connecting to our forgotten wisdom Let this time now teach  Extending roots to nurture And branches to praise Running playing bouncing of edges Feeding on energy captured today  Tag you’re it Come find me, I bet you can’t I’ve perfected this skill Please find me if you will  I love you I want you  I need you Now is the only time we can keep
