What I am imagining for our house is a kind of nautilus shell or cornapoiua structure stretching back into the corner of this spot. The deepest part of the shell is our cave/bedroom space. Structured closely to what the Dome House bedroom is like. Moving out from the back you move out into the world, first stop clothes and a closet space. This will separate the cave from the rest of the world. The next would be the lounging hangout space. The largest space would have the kitchen lots of natural light as open as possible to the world.  The large open end of the kitchen will face south from here, bringing in the best of the sunlight.  I’m thinking we will do the construction of the walls in concrete, Two layers separated by insulation. Within the inner layer we run pex tubing that will be providing radiant heat created by the fireplace. We could have a few zones to direct all the heat to the cave if needed. I’m thinking that we put most of the structure below grade to get thermal benefit,   As we build this space my one request is that when Josh and Collette sell this land we get the current value of this structure at that time.
