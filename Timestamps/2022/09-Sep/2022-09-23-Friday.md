There is some part of me that has an unmet need around your sexuality. Your masturbation bothers me. I want to be part of it, to help or something. I can’t be happy for you or experience the pleasure you are feeling. I am jealous. As I watch I feel left out and then pull back. Shifting this is my next task. Please don’t stop Jennifer, none of this yours to take on.  Once I am spent I just want to hold you and be held. Would you point out if you notice me pulling back?  I imagine you might feel my pulling back as a similar experience you had as a child, your sexuality being restricted.  Does that fit for you? My guess, my little kid feels alone and your little kids experiences manipulation, controlled and restricted feeling rage.  I have been judging your sexuality I am sorry for that.
