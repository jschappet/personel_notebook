Jennifer and I started a little role play today. The play started with a mommy and little boy. One of the first things I asked was if I was doing a good job, and mommy said I was not, she wanted me to stop trying to take care of her. I had been hold her and stroking her hair. I rolled back onto my back let my hand drop and brought my energy back to me. Jennifer asked me a good question at one point.
