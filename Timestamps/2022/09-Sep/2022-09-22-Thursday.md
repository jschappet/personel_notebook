Dear Jennifer,   I love you. As I write that I feel it deep in my heart. Our relationship is very important to me. At the Dome I asked you to be my partner, I didn’t defining what partners meant for me. I think it’s important at this point. For me partnership means we are working together towards a common goal. That’s why I wanted to know if you would talk with Nancy with me. It would show me that we are working together.  All of the things you mentioned about you sexually are things that I would love to explore and play with with you. I am worried that I am not going to have space for needs or wants. I don’t want this to be the end of our road. I want to deepen, grow and live with you.   Jimmy ❤️❤️
