How do I fill my energy needs?   Start by asking for what you need, the world, people, friends, family and partners are all here to be with you and support you. They want to meet your needs just as you like to meet their needs. The reason your needs are going unmet is because you don’t ask. We are interdependent beings, here to help one another.
