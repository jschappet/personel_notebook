Jennifer and I are at an impasse. She is wanting something from me that I can’t seem to figure out how to give her without getting some input from her, and she is refusing to share about her. My continued attempts to connect with her have only pushed her further and further away emotionally. We have stayed close and continued to talk at some level but I keep hearing a no each time I try to connect.   I can express where I am but any attempt to get information from her is rejected.
