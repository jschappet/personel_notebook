It’s been an odd day for me. Lots of feelings and defensiveness. Jennifer and Josh were having a conversation, I was compelled to jump into it, but I’m not sure why. Then when she pushed back on me labeling her as defensive I just ran away. I did not want to see my own feelings. I’m guessing now that I was scared or maybe even just wanting to be included.   What can I create in my imagination that will having me moving towards my desire cleanly?
