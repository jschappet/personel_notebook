I believe I was unfairly treated this evening  I think you were telling me no all night by saying how tired you are I did not express any desire because of the above no I love when you come towards me, drawing out my desire I am needy I want you to flirt with me I feel disappointed and irritated   It seems like I was tricked. I said that there was something to talk about, but you said you were too tired. I heard that and held space for you to be tired.   What would have felt better to me:  I’m tired and I want to spend time with Josh tonight. Will you take a nap with me until he gets here?
