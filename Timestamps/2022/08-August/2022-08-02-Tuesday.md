Happy birthday Jennifer    We had a little issue yesterday when Jennifer waited until the last minute to tell me she needed the RV, and I had to find a different place to sleep. I was feeling very hurt. I could make up a story that my flexibility was taken advantage of. Instead I want a few hours of notice, at least, maybe the day before. This would give me time to make other plans and arrange for a place to sleep. Without that I am left scrambling for a place to sleep and feeling very homeless. Right now this is a very big issue because I don’t have my own space, once we have our own space it becomes a much smaller issue.
