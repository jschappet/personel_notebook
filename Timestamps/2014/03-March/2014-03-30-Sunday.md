# Note for 2014-03-30 (Sunday)

So last night I decided to got for a short ride, and maybe take some pictures. I went back to an old pickup truck, that is very photogenic. I was also able to get some photos on the river at sunset. 


But the nightlight of the night was defiantly the young lady who decided to relieve herself right on the sidewalk in the middle of downtown. Stay classy Iowa city.
