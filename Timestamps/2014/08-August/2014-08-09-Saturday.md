# Note for 2014-08-09 (Saturday)

Today we honor Jean Schappet, by all accounts she was/is a terrific person who will be cherished and loved by many for many years. 

The ceremony was conducted by Randy Miller, with Bob and Bill Blevins, Jimmy King, Beth Gilliland, and Pastor Goodwin speaking. Stories where shared, necks were hugged and tears were shed. All thus to celebrate an woman, my mother, who died too soon.
