# Note for 2014-05-10 (Saturday)

Spending the weekend in Maryland visiting with Mom, Patty and Jay. We are going to grandma and grandpa's house tomorrow. After that I head off to NIH for the TCGA Symposium. 

Mom has become much more unstable over the last month. She is now using a walker all the time. 

She is in time released morfeen( need to look up the spelling)

This has caused her some poo issues. She has not gone since Wednesday.
