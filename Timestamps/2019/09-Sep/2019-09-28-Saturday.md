Yeah, last night I had 3 puffs. It was a really cool experience.  Once it started to hit me, the things I focused on, came into very sharp focus, and the things I was not focused on would just go out of focus and almost disappear.    But I was able to shift focus from the person talking, to road noise, to something touching my foot back. And while watching the person talking, the view of her was super in focus, and had a very 3d like effect.
