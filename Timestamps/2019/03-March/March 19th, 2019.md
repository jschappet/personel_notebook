**March 19th, 2019**

Yesterday Audrey was diagnosed with a torn MCL. This means that she is only getting around on three legs now. And at 11 years old I’m unwilling to put her through surgery again. It feels like this is being heartless and cold. Right now we can’t get to the end of my very short street without her getting worn out. I know that if she does not get to walking more, I’m going to have to make the difficult decision to put her down. In many ways I feel like I’ve already done this. I’m feeling very selfish by not wanting to take care of my aging dog. If she can’t walk well, is her quality of life that good? If she’s still happy and up beat is her quality of life that bad? I don’t need to decide anything right now, but as I look down the road to moving to Portland this decision will become important. Am I doing what’s right for me or am I doing what’s right for Audrey? Which one is more important? I guess I need to follow my own advice and stay present. Audrey is in good shape right now, see how she adapts to her new life. And then in a few months I can see where she is.
