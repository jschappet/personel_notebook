Dear Mr. Knosp, 
I am writing to inform you that I am leaving my position, Lead Application Developer at the University of Iowa ICTS. Per our conversation, my last day working for ICTS will be Tuesday December 31st 2019. It has been a pleasure working for and with you. I greatly appreciate the opportunities and mentoring you offered me. If in the future I can be of any assistance to you, please let me know. 

Best regards, 


James Schappet
