## Preparing to Interview You on the Nature of Consciousness and Reality

### 1. **The Foundational Statement**

> _“I believe consciousness is the phenomenon that we see and interpret as the physical world.”_

- When did this idea first begin to form in you?

- Was it sudden, like a flash of insight—or gradual, like a coastline coming into view?
    
- If you could place this belief in your body, where would you feel it?
    
- What does this idea **free you from**? And what does it **ask you to carry**?
    

---

### 2. **The Mapping Instinct**

> _You test truth through mapping, metaphor, and resonance across systems._

- What are some other metaphors that help you hold or explain this idea?
    
- Can you describe a moment when a mapping from another domain “clicked” for you?
    
- What happens in you when something resonates as universal?
    
- What does _coherence_ feel like to you?
    

---

### 3. **Embodied Knowing**

> _“Does this feel true?” is a central compass._

- What does “feeling true” mean in your own lived experience?
    
- How do you distinguish emotional desire from intuitive knowing?
    
- Are there times when your body said yes before your mind could catch up?
    
- Has anything ever felt _true_ before it made _sense_?
    

---

### 4. **Philosophical Lineage**

> _You're not alone—this is part of a deep metaphysical tradition._

- Which thinkers, traditions, or teachings have echoed this truth for you?
    
- Have you encountered resistance—internally or externally—when sharing this?
    
- What’s your relationship to “proof” and “falsifiability” in ideas like this?
    
- Do you think your view is a belief, a perception, or a recognition?
    

---

### 5. **Living the Belief**

> _This isn’t abstract—it changes how you live, relate, create._

- How does this belief shape the way you relate to others?
    
- How does it change your view of suffering, time, or death?
    
- What does it do to your sense of agency, purpose, or the sacred?
    
- Can you recall a moment when this belief gave you strength—or clarity?
    

---

### 6. **Edges and Tensions**

> _All meaningful ideas cast a shadow._

- Where does this belief still feel tender, untested, or unresolved?
    
- Are there limits to what it can explain? Where does it meet mystery?
    
- How do you hold paradox within this view—especially when life is difficult?
    
- Do you ever miss the simplicity of the materialist view?
    

---

### 7. **Language as Interface**

> _The flame/fire analogy moved you. Metaphor is a way of knowing._

- Why do you think this analogy (flame = world; fire = consciousness) works so well for you?
    
- If you were to craft your own metaphor for consciousness and reality, what would it be?
    
- Do you think there’s a language of reality that lies _before_ words?
    

---

### 8. **Toward a New Cosmology**

> _You are composing a cosmology—not a closed system, but a living one._

- If a child asked you, “Where is the world?” how might you answer?
    
- What does a culture look like that lives from this truth?
    
- What kind of ethics naturally arises from this metaphysics?
    
- If science were to catch up to your view, what would it study differently?
    

---

### 9. **A Final Personal Question**

> _In the end, this is about relationship._

- What is your relationship to consciousness itself?
    
- Is it _you_? Is it something you move through? Or something that moves through you?
    
- If you could speak directly to consciousness—as if it were listening—what would you say?

## _“Hot Ones” Interviewer’s Notes: Sean Evans Talks Consciousness with You_

> **Theme:** “So you’re telling me... the world is what consciousness _looks like_ from the outside?”

---

### 1. **The Opening Hook (Mild Sauce, Full Flavor)**

> "Let’s kick this off easy. This belief you have—that consciousness is the phenomenon we interpret as the physical world—it’s not something you hear every day at a backyard BBQ."

- Where did this belief start for you?
    
- Was it a slow burn or more like a flashbang moment?
    
- If this idea were a hot sauce, what would its Scoville rating be?
    

---

### 2. **The Deep Cut**

> "Now, I did some digging—and I found out you’re not just tossing out metaphysics at brunch. You actually test these beliefs through something you call _mapping_."

- Can you walk us through your “map test” for truth?
    
- How do you know when something fits across systems versus when it’s just wishful thinking?
    
- Is there a concept from physics or biology that unexpectedly helped this belief ‘click’ for you?
    

---

### 3. **Philosophy Meets Street Smarts**

> "You’ve said you live by the question ‘does this feel true?’ Some people might say that sounds a little... soft. But I get it—you’re basically running your own internal _truth polygraph_."

- How do you personally know the difference between “truth-feeling” and “emotional bias”?
    
- What’s an example of an idea that passed your felt-sense test _before_ it made logical sense?
    
- Have you ever gotten burned by something that felt true but wasn’t?
    

---

### 4. **The Flame-Fire Metaphor (Getting Spicier)**

> "You resonated with that flame-to-fire metaphor: the physical world is to consciousness as the flame is to fire. That’s poetic as hell. But let me ask: if the world is the flame, what’s the _fuel_?"

- Where does the “fire” of consciousness come from, in your view?
    
- Is consciousness a thing? A field? An activity?
    
- How does this metaphor help you live differently day to day?
    

---

### 5. **Science Tries to Catch Up**

> "I’m throwing in a science curveball here: people like Donald Hoffman and the folks behind Integrated Information Theory are trying to build testable models of this stuff."

- Do you think we’ll ever have a lab test for your view of consciousness?
    
- What’s your reaction when science tries to reduce the mystery of consciousness to brain functions?
    
- Is falsifiability even the right metric for something this... massive?
    

---

### 6. **The “No Easy Answers” Round**

> "You believe something pretty foundational. But beliefs like this don’t get off easy. So tell me…"

- What’s the strongest critique of your view that you’ve ever heard?
    
- What part of this belief still gives you pause or keeps evolving?
    
- If you had to poke a hole in it, where would you start?
    

---

### 7. **Audience Challenge**

> "Let’s say someone watching this wants to start exploring this idea for themselves. What's their first step? What should they look for? What should they _feel_ for?"

- What experiences or questions tend to open this door for people?
    
- Is this a perspective that has to be _earned_ through life, or can it hit someone cold?
    
- How do you explain this idea to a 10-year-old... or your grandma?
    

---

### 8. **The Legacy Question (Final Boss Sauce)**

> "Okay. This is the Last Dab moment. Let’s say you get to leave one message for the future. A society of post-materialist humans trying to make sense of what’s real."

- What truth would you hand them from this belief?
    
- What do you hope they _feel_ when they hear it?
    
- If consciousness is the fire… what kind of world do you want that fire to light up?
