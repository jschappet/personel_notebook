Yes. Uh let me try to find the words in English. When the things like uh when when the things are like they are uh you can say it if you say it in Spanish too it might help.

Okay. Well uh no when the things like I are they are it's important that you pay attention and what uh is invite the situation to you which is the invitation of this situation to you? Uh Which part of you needs uh reinforcing or development inside you to face the situation.

Can sort of I can sort of see feel um energy coming up from my solar plexus up sort of supporting my heart.

You are feeling that?

Yeah.

Okay. Wow.

Yeah.

Feels like an answer to your question of what what's needing support. It's like my

my I am I'm supporting my heart.

Your heart. Yeah. But um the thing is here to support uh I I see the a kind of image of the heart when when there is have some wounds, some wounds and the wounds are sometimes bleeding a bit bleeding.

Uh but the situation invites you invite invite you to do something with the it's like to push you to do something that's instead of thinking how to change the situation push you to look for do something different inside you. Uh so see what what the situation invite invite you to do. Uh some I understand this I don't know if it is has sense for you but I am trying to continue to to see what what else M

what I'm hearing you say is the um in these situations what is the I'm being invited to do something different and what is it what is it asking what is this situation asking for me and how do I respond differently

yes this is the thing I'm hear I'm hearing this message a couple different places.

Um which uh do you need to develop inside you to face this situation? You understand? It's like for example I have to go for a tunnel and it's very dark. I need to turn on the light for something.

Yeah. It's a metaphor metaphor.

Yeah. The message I've been getting from other places is it's the it's anger and rage that are buried deep

my cosmic my cosmic know.

Nice. Let me see. I cuz I'm trying not to use my mind only I understand that you have a to use a kind of extren strength. or force inside you that you are not using at all. So the situation pulls you to invite you to you to have the opportunity to develop this energy um something like this. So for example um let it outside this energy uh use in a good way or I don't know if maybe speak louder or something like this. Um I don't know if it is related with the with the children's or with the the people who who you live with. You are but appears some some sensation of that.

I'm well I am trying to do my best. So you take it only that is useful for you. If something is not clear maybe we can

um so far everything you've said makes a lot of sense. It's in line with a lot of things that I've been hearing. So there's a a a softening and uh getting bigger that I've been sort of working working towards. How can I soften and get bigger?

Yeah. Well, they show me when you say that they show me some a movement of your energies like when the energy goes to the the earth to the center of the earth then can go up with more strength like and we are part of that. So you can use your for example when when you feel a kind of annoyance or annoying. Annoy annoying

What I do differently. What I do differently. from you. Oh no. From now until to my end I going to be in my way.

From now till my end I'm going to be in my way. Um, imagine that you are surrounded. You are inside a I can see you are inside a white cylinder of light surrounding you and your father also. So now you're going to feel in your hands the heaviness of the energy that you hold up from your father until today. So in your h in your hands is going to appear a kind of objects or that represent the heaviness of this.

Feel how your body how how your body feel. to have this. And now put the objects near from the foots of your father inside the cylinder, the white cylinder of light that Hold him and tell him, "Father, I leave you."

So, is near the folds of his cylinder. And now come back to your cylinder and feel your body again and see what happened. What do you feel in your body now?

Okay. Feel the brightness in Feel the brightness. And now with this brightness go to the situation that you face at the beginning. We were talking at the beginning and stand up with this rhinest in front of this another scenary or situation. Uh breathe inhale and exhale. Check how is to be in that situation with this energy. How do you feel? Um feeling a confidence going in with the like that tool of stepping into that grounding earth energy on keep your attention in the heart center because it's appearing that your mind is activation have an activation. So we need you keep in your heart center again. Inhale and exhale. If you need put your hand in the heart. Now come back to the to the room that you visualize at the beginning in which you are still and quiet resting in your own place inside your heart. And from this place connect with this present that you are here with me doing this these things. In your home with me, you're going to see that the brightness of that part of you inside the heart increase and you emanate microfilaments of of light for all your skin. and feel again the foot in the in the floor. You can open your eyes and the movements that you need. Come back. here with me.

Hello.

Hello. Well, um now uh let me see. Tell me uh how how are you? If you want to share something or if you want to check the the questions or the topics that you write in your You want to uh do another question

um

or or or express something that you want. I am here for

um I think one of the things that I would be up for it's doing the doing the same thing with the mother but my mother. Um, and otherwise I'm doing really well. I'm feeling a lot of emotion moving. So, I'm have tears moving and like

can feel the energy in my body changing sort of

ripples of things along my spine.

Um, so I'm feeling very impacted by what's going on. Okay, I'm happy to hear that. Uh the mother we is it's they show me that is it's is enough for today because it's it's important that you feel this and you process this. Uh and it seems is maybe the we we can do another time with your mother but it seems that the the challenge that you have today is more related with this part with your father part. So that makes sense. He was the one that actually had more I think he had more repressed anger and rage.

Yeah. So because this is the option that you give to him because it's like a mechanism. When we are a child uh children sometimes we we incorporate the way that they have to deal with the things and then it's something automatically and we have a we are trying we they show me to do this exercise with you because it's important that do this distinction because Yeah, it's only a way to be. You can be another way and it's okay for you and for your father if you are in different way.

Yeah.

Your father is still alive or is not alive or something?

No, he passed away in 2018. Both my parents have passed. No.

Okay. Um,

how do you think how do you feel about the past of your father's parents?

Um, I think I I went through a a big arc where I I saw him as being flawed

and so I had a lot more compassion for him after that. And and as he would after my mom died, he started sort of shifting as well and um ended up getting in sick himself. But I just had a lot of compassion for him going through that dying process as well.

So I think I had a pretty good arc with him.

Arc would

like a story like a story arc where you know Psalm is psalm is perfect and then psalm is flawed and then psalm is human and

you know

sal okay well let me see if there is something else it seems they are very happy because you are you have the the opportunity you you give the opportunity to yourself to liberate that and to feel that and it's a bigger step. They say they show me also that I don't know if you do a kind of workout or move your body, you do something.

They show me like um that find maybe it could be useful for you. Find an activity in which you use energy like run or like

working physical physical working labor probably.

Yes. To to

Yeah.

to feel to let the body take out all the energy. Not uh they show me a kind of balance that you need to to take care of. It's like

Yeah. All right.

If the energy is time here,

I know what this message means.

Okay. You have this message also. If the energy is like an engineering thing, if the energy is surrounded here uh needs to go down. Go down. Go to the to the heart but go to the body. And when you move your body, you push the energy down and you need push the energy down. So you are very uh smart uh how to say very your mind is very deep below. You don't need to do more with your mind. Your mind is very developed. So now it's good to find a better balance with your energy to to do this movement of the energy in the in your meditations visualization to go here to go here and here here.

Mhm.

Because um There is a kind of balance between the three centers of the body and sometimes it's it seems that your energy is more and you content the energy there and do a kind of um very a kind of workout like really soothing you soothing

and move the body and it's going to give a Another kind of balance and it's good to root you. Root you and with this begin uh another kind of way to to be in the life also. So I always to to do the the draw because appear like

it's like the body okay the body is you are more here more here more here

right

and you have to do this this movement more here more here more here more here more here more here more here more here more here less here So the the activity is going to help you with that is one of the things. Um and use the site like use they show me an image like for example go to walk in the street. and walk open the open the eyes and look in the things like without um with without nothing with with a lot of curiosity like

like imagine that in your sides you have a kind of light that goes out and illuminate the things that you see. So Share this with the things with the trees, with the people, with Hi. Like let the let the space in your eyes to the energy goes appear also in the heart also in the body. They show me that. Would you like to do another question or tell something?

I'm just so enjoying the the message that you're sharing. Like there's a At the beginning of it, there's a slicing quality, but the what's being replaced, the the action that you're talking about, going out on the street and just sort of imagining my eyes are illuminating things and that feels very powerful.

Yeah, it's a nice practice. Uh, it seems a nice practice. It seems your energy need to it's like a it's like a sun that do this. Imagine that you are like the sun and the sun do this by the eyes by the skin by the back by the front by and it's happening that They are you are doing that right now. But they show you how to how to increase that.

They turn it up. Yeah.

And using your home also in their home. In your home.

Use this energy in your home. It's good for the home. The home needs needs this energy from you. You are there from the Because of that also you have a they say you have a a role there but this role need this part of you also and you are very you are doing very well but this this moment you put this more energy out more energy out. So it seems you learn how to be how to how to balance your energy very well. But they need you use your fire like more not from a nice way like the passion the I don't know I I don't know how to express but this is the sensation. It's like I'm here. I do in my way. Is is this this gratitude. I'm here. I do my way with love and with strength and with affirmation. Something like this is well um I have to finish. Um I would like to stay more with you maybe if in appear something else. that you want to share, you can send me an audio by WhatsApp or we can speak another day. H but it's important we do the close.

Yes.

Are you okay with that?

Yes, I'm I'm perfect.

Okay. You're going to put to to stand up and to put one one hand here, the other hand in the her and you are going to imagine in your in the part in the the plants of your foot begin to grow grow up uh big roots of light that goes to the center of the land of the earth. Inhale and exhale. Inhale by the nose. It's held by the mouse. Inhale by the nose. Exhale by the mouth. Do a good feel. Let all the the heaviness go to the land and feel the connection with the floor with the land in your fs. Let the space to all the sediments of this meeting do a process in you. This is going to take Maybe two months or maybe streaming is going to process. So metabolize you're going metabolize this all these things. Amen. Amen. Amen.
