# Relational Archetypes & Tending with Genevieve  
*Journal Reflection – June 25, 2025*

## 🌿 Context

Recently, a conflict arose in a circling community where Genevieve was verbally attacked by another member, Jan. I was present but did not step in to protect her. Genevieve shared that my absence was deeply hurtful and echoed past experiences of being blamed and left out—of being the "black sheep."

My initial justification was that I believe people should ask for help directly. However, this event revealed a pattern in our relationship where I’ve failed to consistently offer a protective or attuned presence—not out of unwillingness, but from a deeper belief that each person must manage themselves. Genevieve’s request has invited me to reimagine what presence and protection can look like in relationship.

## 🔱 Archetypes in Relationship

I explored how the *ReVillaged masculine archetypes* can guide me into a deeper, truer form of love—one that does not abandon my freedom, but includes her in my field.

**Cues**:
- A touch on her shoulder

- Follow-up question: *“Hey, I felt something shift. Are you okay?”*  
**Mantra**: *“I keep a part of my shield turned toward her.”*

---

### 👑 Steward  
**Essence**: Blesses and includes. Carries the partnership as part of his sovereign field.

## ✨ Genevieve’s Direct Ask

> *“When we’re in group spaces, especially ones that feel emotionally charged or intense for me, I would love to feel your steady presence with me — not necessarily through constant attention, but through subtle cues that let me know you’re tracking me and that I haven’t fallen out of your field.”*

> *“If I go quiet, or leave the room, or seem less available, I’d love for you to notice that and gently check in — even with just a look, a pause, or a question later like: ‘Hey, I felt something shift. Are you okay?’ That lets my system know I’m not alone.”*

> *“And when you’re drawn into connection with others — especially women who have emotional charge or spark — I’d like you to stay aware of how that might land for me in the moment. Not because I want to limit your connection, but because I want us both to hold the field of our bond with care. I want to feel chosen — not just in private, but also in public.”*

> *“I don’t need all of you, all the time. But I need to feel that what we have is being consciously tended — especially in subtle, emotionally vulnerable spaces.”*

## 💬 My Response (Journal Draft)

> “Reading your ask felt like you were laying a thread from your heart to mine. It helped me understand something that’s been alive for a while but never quite this clearly: that you’re not asking me to stop being me, or to monitor you—but to include you more intentionally in the way I move through the world, especially in subtle and emotionally charged spaces.  
>
> That doesn’t feel like a burden. It feels like an invitation to deepen.  
>
> I want to be the kind of partner who tracks you—not out of fear, but out of love. Who reaches for you when you go quiet. Who lets you feel, in group space, that you’re not alone. Who makes it known, even without words, that you’re the one I choose.  
>
> That will take practice. But your clarity helps me orient. And I’m here for it.”

## 🔄 Ongoing Practice

- Attune gently in group spaces: practice scanning the field for her state, without gripping.
- Offer gestures of presence—especially when she quiets or exits.
- Bring awareness to charged dynamics with others and reflect afterward if something might’ve landed off.
- Affirm, regularly and in subtle ways, that I choose her—and not just in private.

## 🌱 Closing

This moment feels like an initiation—not into more work, but into deeper love. One where I remain *in my center*, but widen the circle of that center to include her in my conscious field.

This is not about abandoning my flow.  
This is about **including her in it**.
