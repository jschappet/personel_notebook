#  Daily Threshold Ritual

_Use this template each morning or evening to cross the threshold into your true self._

## 1. Anointing: Acknowledgment of Where You Are

- Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly.
    
- Take 3 slow breaths.
    
- Journal or speak aloud:
    
    > “I am no longer trying to return.”  
    > “I am no longer waiting to become.”  
    > “I stand in the between, where truth grows.”
    

**Thoughts/Feelings:**

```
- I feel the quiet of now
- I feel a bit empty
- Hopeful and trying to fit/create time for this new practice in my day.
- 
```

## 2. Release: Shedding the Old Shape

- Ask:
    
    > “What am I still carrying today that I no longer need to?”  
    > “Whose emotions, needs, or expectations linger in my field?”
    
- Name one and describe briefly:
    

```
-
```

- Declare:
    
    > “This is not mine to hold. I return it.”

## 3. Reclaim: Return to Self-Center

- Ask:
    
    > “What truth is waiting to be lived through me today?”  
    > “If I trusted my own fire, how would I move?”
    
- Summarize in seven words or fewer:
    

```
-
```

## 4. Consecrate: Embody the New Pattern

- Choose one micro-action to enact today (select one):
    
    -  Say no to a request I normally over-give to.
        
    -  Leave a message unread without guilt.
        
    -  Dance for 30 seconds before my next task.
        
    -  Eat slowly, without multitasking.
        
    -  Take a 5-minute silent walk.
        
    -  Other: ________________________________

## 5. Seal: Closing Blessing

- Whisper:
    
    > “I am allowed to outgrow what once held me.”  
    > “I cross clean. I cross true. I carry only what is mine.”
    

**Final Reflection:**
