I was in awe of the whole process and brought to tears.

# üìù Notes
Today I am celebrating with wonder that is circling. I felt a lot of awe in my circle this morning watching everyone come together around a tender topic. 

Struggle I'm having is allowing my No and not taking on the shame or guilt of having a no or even a trigger. 

Looking forward to a time of peace, or at least the finding the peace in myself.
