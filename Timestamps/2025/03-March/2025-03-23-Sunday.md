# üìù Notes
- I just want to take a moment to imagine the power telepathy for human possibility. If we could think telepathically with one mind across the planet for the good of all of us here every bit of consciousness working with one intention, how would the world look, how would it be different? How would it be the same? 
To be telepathic, you need to be undefended. A spiritual being of love. So this would fundamentally change everything
