# Note for 2017-05-31 (Wednesday)

Today is my twentieth wedding anniversary.

And I am on the verge of asking for a divorce. As Tina said, I'm lost, and need to find out who I am. I have never lived on my own. I have changed and shaped myself to fit into someone else's life for as long as I can remember. 
Working for my parents or following Tina's career from place to place. I don't regret any of these choices. 

I've been on a path of self discovery, and I think it's time for the next step.
