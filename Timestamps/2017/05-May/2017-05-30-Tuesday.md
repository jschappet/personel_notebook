# Note for 2017-05-30 (Tuesday)

Yesterday Tina and I had a discussion about goals  and fears that devolved into her saying I'm a bully and asshole. 

There are a few questions I have been trying to answer for some time now:
- Am I the a good person for Tina
- Is Tina a good person for me to be with
- Am I just afraid if divorce, I may be because I have a hard time writing and saying it. 
- Is my urge to explore right now running away from something or running to it
- Not an old question but, am I a bully


I know I have been in the process of changing. I am working to remove the restrictions I have placed on myself to make others happy.
