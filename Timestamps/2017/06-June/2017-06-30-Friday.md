Capote's style of writing reminds me of the parts of Tom Clancy's stories and JK Rowelling.  Each of these authors takes several different story lines and expertly winds the treads into one beautiful structure. Each part in the the overall story has beginning, middle and end, and often if separated from the whole would be very compelling. But when taken together, these part become much more powerful.
