One week down

It's been one week since I told Tina I wanted a divorce. Today I went to see the lawyer, and he has indicated that we can use one lawyer because our case is simple enough. This is what we were both hoping for. I'm not sure if Tina will someday see that this was a good decision, but maybe she be angers with me forever. 

So far we have been able to speak calmly and rationally throughout the process. The next major step will be for me to retain counsel and file for divorce.
