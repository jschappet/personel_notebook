# Note for 2017-06-08 (Thursday)

I have asked Tina for a divorce. 

I had a realization while sitting waiting for Tina to finish speaking with the counselor. For the last twenty years I have been "Tina's husband, Jimmy". Today's decision is about me becoming Jimmy. 

The question that comes up from this, however, is why do I need to divorce Tina to become Jimmy. Before Tina and I started dating, people may have called me a Momma's boy. And they would have been right. I transferred all of theses expectations and responsibilities to Tina. I let her dictate many parts of my life. Everything from facial hair to where we lived have been highly influenced by Tina. So much so that I have lost track of what are my wants versus what I did in support of her. 

So the next step for me will be to figure out who is Jimmy and live with him for a little while, I've heard from a few people that he is a nice guy. 

Here's to a lifetime of self discovery.
