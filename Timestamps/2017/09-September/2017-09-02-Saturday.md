# Note for 2017-09-02 (Saturday)

Last night Teresa and I ended our relationship. She was not interested in being a second priority to anyone. I understand where that was coming from and accepted it, but there is still a sting and some frustration from me. I was clear from the start that I was not interested in an exclusive relationship, but she was not ok with my level of interest in her. She thought when I did not make plans with her I was disinterested. 

I was also told this morning the Esther has found someone and does not want to pursue anything with me. She is interested in keeping in touch and so am I. 

The interesting thing for me is the urge to instantly restart Tinder. I have not. I think I will continue on my current path, and wait out the year. For now anyway, maybe someone will setup up on a blind date.
