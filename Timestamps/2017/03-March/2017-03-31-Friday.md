# Note for 2017-03-31 (Friday)

Last night I dreamed that I was driving through a neighborhood probably somewhere in St. Charles going down the big hill maybe a foot and a half to 2 feet of snow piles of snow and stuff cars all over the place I was driving or being my BMW car and I'm having no problems getting through the snow and eventually I saw eventually I was flagged down by Vicki Eichorn
