# Note for 2017-08-02 (Wednesday)

A lot of people have been saying, do what makes you happy. But that can come across as selfishness. Why do we trap ourselves with these negative thoughts. 

By doing the things that make you happy, you are being you. Not only that you are being the best version of you. 

So find out who you are, be happy and joyous, and share that good energy with others.
