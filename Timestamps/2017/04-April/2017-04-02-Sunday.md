I had two dreams last night one I was at a new house it was being constructed and we were working on some homework nation for this house that included voice activation sort of Alexa like technology out by the pool

The second dream and I was at a theater watching a new Spiderman movie in this movie there was a break in the action on the screen and people came out and actually started repelling down walls I was sitting I was sitting in the audience of course not wearing any pants pretty typical of one of my dreams
Most interesting was the end of these two dreams I got an alert on my watch but I was not wearing that showed some delayed text messages that come in reminding me of my dreams
