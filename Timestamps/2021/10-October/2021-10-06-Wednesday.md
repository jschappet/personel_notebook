Return to home  As the creek rolls flowing down  Following a force it does not know Tumbling bubbling watering nurturing Away for so long Always the same  The creek meets the ocean every day And yet it takes millennia for one drop to Find its way back home  What home am I returning to? How long has my journey been? Is this some place I have ever been before in this lifetime? What awaits me?  The end of suffering  The end of longing The hoping fulfilled Love  unvarnished  I am but a single drop connected to everything Flowing with forces I do not know Returning to a home I have never known
