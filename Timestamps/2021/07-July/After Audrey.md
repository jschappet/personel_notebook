This was a story idea about my life after Putting Audrey my dog to sleep. 



There is a whole world out there for me to explore so many things I have never done or seen. I can see the doorway ahead, just out of reach. Out of reach for now I tell myself. Then I start to think of all the things that are in reach that I’m not doing, not going on hikes, not seeing friends, not making new friend. The only thing I’m making these days is excuses. I can’t go over night because of Audrey, she’s dying slowly from cancer and I have to be here for her. Is this really true? What’s going to happen to me when she is gone? I’ve been pinning so many of my excuses on her I will have to face the fact that one day I will have to decide for her.

That is the choice I have to make, when will something die? In this case the thing that will cease to be alive is my dog Audrey. Today she is alive and breathing, at some point in the future I will decide what day she dies. So much of my life right now is restricted and limited by the breath of another living thing. All I want at this point is freedom to move, but I can’t make the one decision that would set me free. All I have to do is Kill Audrey. Then I’ll be free. The inflection point is not quite fine enough yet. The two lines that are converging are her lifeline and my line to freedom!
