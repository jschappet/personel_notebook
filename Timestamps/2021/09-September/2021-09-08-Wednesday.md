### Time: 7:04 AM

It was late on a Tuesday night he was just about to head to bed when she texted him. They hadn’t seen each other since they “broke up”. He was going to be moving out of town so they decided to break things off, it had been a good relationship but not something either were expecting to last forever so it ended very peacefully. Her text that night was not unexpected, they had been keeping in touch since the break up, however the content was an instant turn on for him. It said, “I’m in town tonight and a little tipsy. Can I come over? 😈”  When she arrived there was a sense of urgency and impatience about her. Once she walked in the front door, she was greeted by a very excited dog, Max had also not seen her in some time. Max loved her, and had to make sure she knew it. She barely acknowledged Max, she simply said, “Hi Max, I’m not here to see you.” Max quietly went back to bed.   As Max walked up the stairs, the two of them were left alone in the foyer again. She immediately started kissing him. He could feel her desire matching his own. She quickly began pulling his pants off, and then took off her own. She was in control and knew what she wanted, she wanted him inside here right now.   He held her in a tight embrace kissing her mouth, cheek and biting her neck all while pushing her against the walk. He grabbed her ass lifted her slightly and the lowered her back onto his cock. He knew he was not going to last very long. With the first few thrusts her breathing had become very quick and erratic. After a few more powerful thrusts lifting her off the floor again he exploded inside of her.   As both of their breathing had returned to a more normal pace he said “Hello.”    With her hunger satisfied, they finally moved up the stairs, out of the foyer and into the house. They went straight to the bedroom, removing the rest of their clothes along the way. The fucking was done, now it was time to make love.
