While I can’t draw a picture recreating the beauty of your face, I figured I would give it a try in words.   There is a contest between the eyes and the smile Moving from one to the other Pulled back and forth  Transfixed by the eyes Warmed by the smile  I break the trance by engaging  Consider texture touch Smoothing your eyebrow with a caress  I each hair connecting energizing the tip of my finger  This moment of study so intimate  It can be difficult to hold The look draws me in again I’m the contest between eyes and smile I win
