Lounging in a hammock under tall trees Breeze swinging me gently  Dappled sun warming my salty skin Nature among the bustle and hustle of the world Road noise disrupts the music of the leaves  Pushed or pulled I’m not sure Away from the disorder disconnection distraction  To the pure simple music of nature
