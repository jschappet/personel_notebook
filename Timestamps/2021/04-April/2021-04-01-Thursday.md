My date was great, dancing, sex a few times lots of snuggles. However the drive home sucked. My car decided that it did not want to have oil in it anymore. So I stopped at a gas station at 12:05, added two quarts of oil, that just poured right through. Called a tow truck, had the car taken to the dealership. Then instead of waiting 25 minutes for an Uber, I walked the 2 miles the rest of the way home. Got to bed around 1:45.   Just got off the phone with the dealership, looks like my car will need a new engine. The drain plug was loose. They are covering the replacement of the engine because they just changed the oil a few weeks ago.
