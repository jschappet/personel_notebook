Who am I

For a very long time I have identified myself as Jimmy, but not just Jimmy. Typically it was Jean’s son Jimmy and then Tina’s husband Jimmy. The day I asked for my divorce I finally made a realization. Somewhere along the way I had lost my understanding of who I am. What makes me unique and special, I lost track of who I am. Because of this I have constantly sought to define myself with respect to another. I have continued this as I began dating other people, instead of defining my own life, I looked toward their life for purpose and meaning in my own. So what is uniquely me. Eckhart Tolle would have me simply say, “I am.” that should be sufficient. I’m not quite there just yet. I am currently defining my life as what I do, I am an application developer working for a university, transitioning into a new career as a health coach. I am a yogi, which mean I go and practice yoga from time to time, sometimes as much as 4 times a week. I am a son, but both my parents are now dead. They both passed away in the last 4 year. My mom went first she was diagnosed with PML, spent 1 year in Hospice care before dying. My father lost a short battle with esophageal cancer about 7 months from diagnosis to death. This has left me in a place where I have little family. My closest living relative is my sister. Three of my four grandparents have passed away, and my mom’s mom is the last one I have left. So, how do I get from where I am now, App Dev → Health Coach to being “I am.” I think this is the question I have been struggling with I have been looking for home. I lost my parents, so that is not home. I have moved away from the church I grew up in, so that is not home. Moving away from the church also means the family I have left does not feel like home, we have diverged 

How do I find home
