Quinton was punching Eric so I picked him up and took him outside. I went back out to check on him and he continued to fight back. I held him down and told him I would let him go back I. The house when he calmed down. When I let him go he ran off and left the yard. He’s got some blood on his shirt from a cut I got on my finger earlier in the day.
