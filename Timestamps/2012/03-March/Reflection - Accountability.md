I my leadership journey I told you a story about, an enormous mistake I made. This could have very easily be a CLE, Career Limiting Event.  My mistake lead to thousands of people being locked out of all of the Production Web Applications for almost 45 minutes.  In the moments after this mistake I had a few options, hide the issue, blame someone else, or simply ignore the problem.  

  

Any one of these options could have saved me the embarrassment of having to admit my mistake, but more likely would have prolong the outage, then gotten me fired. (Much more embarrassing) My choice was instead to inform my boss of the situation, detail what I had done, the impact on the users, and the systems that were effected.  We were then able to quickly deal with this issue.  At this point there was no one pointing fingers, no yelling, and no threats of be canned.  I stepped up took responsibility for my actions.  While this is not something we have learned directly in MOR, can roll up a few concepts.

  

Two concepts that stand out in my mind are, "Be Intentional' and owning your emotions. When you are intentional in your actions and you own your emotions you are taking accountability for yourself.  

  

The next step in this process would be stepping up, and taking accountability for your Group. As a leader you now have the opportunity to show others the importance of Accountability. When a problem or issue arises, its time for you as the leader to own the issue. 

- First step, admit there is an issue
    
- Step two, resolve the issue
    
- Step three, determine the root cause of the issue
    
- Step four, take steps to ensure it does not happen again
    

It's important to note, there is no finger pointing or redirecting blame. Own the issue, fix it, and move on.
