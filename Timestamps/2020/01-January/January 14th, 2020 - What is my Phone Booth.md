What is my phonebooth?

Superman lives life as a rather normal timed man, named Clark Kent. But just because he is Clark Kent does not mean his superpowers have gone away. Clark Kent can still leap building is a single bound and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, but he keeps this part of himself hidden. 

Because he does not want to draw attention to himself. But what if you do want to draw attention to yourself? What if you want the world to know you have this really cool superpower? For Clark Kent, he goes into a phonebooth, removes his glasses and shirt and comes out Superman. 

I want people to see my superpower all the time!
I want to be living in my superpower, not being afraid of drawing attention to myself.

I have experienced this superpower a few times. It’s an intense calm that is centered and grounded, un-effected by the levels of excitement others experience. On a personal level this means I can avoid making spur of the moment decisions on impulse purchases or high-pressure sales pitches, for my coaching practice it means I can be present for someone during very difficult times and allow their emotional energy to drain through me.

This calm and centeredness comes at a cost. People tend to be attracted to the flash and highly visible, this means that I can become invisible. I want to be visible, no, attractive to other. Drawing them towards me, instead of chasing.

When I have felt my superpower turned on, I could feel my sides warm up, at the same time a few people around said they were seeing me for the first time. That’s the space I want to life in.

Behind me was a picture of a lion. The lion was just lying on the ground not doing anything. But despite that you can sense his power. 

He doesn’t have to explain how strong he his. 
He doesn’t have to do anything to impress you. 
He doesn’t even give a fuck if you are impressed.

He is a lion.
He hunts when he needs to, sometimes he wins sometimes he losses, oh well

I’ll be on the lookout for a good Lion
