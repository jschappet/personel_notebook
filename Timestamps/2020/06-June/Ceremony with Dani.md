Sunday:

The ceremony started with a settling, we had a brief conversation about what was going to happen, then we made some mushroom tea with apple cider. I sat and drank the tea and eat the last of the mushroom bits. Dani started to ask questions and tried to provoke me. 

Some of the conversion contained question and reflections about my childhood, bringing up feelings towards my mom. What percentage of my childhood did I feel was spent trying to please my mom to get attention? I replied, “My answer is not a number, but rather all the time”. Dani asked the same question about my dad. My answer was the same, I spent my childhood working for attention and recognition from my parents. There was also a question about my earliest memory of my father, the one that came to mind was about getting “geesy” with him while he was working on a trailer. Dani reflected back my story, emphasizing how angry and frustrating this must have been. How the two most important people in my life required that I work to get there attention and love. 

Telling me it was “Ok” to be angry, I was free to do or say anything. This was my intention of for this experience to drop my filters, to fully express myself. 

I noticed a slight separation from the feeling of being provoked and who was doing the provoking. I also noticed that I created a safe space for myself. Having Colleen there with me, gave me a place to retreat too. It was us against them. In my head it was not Dani provoking me, but “She was provoking me”. (Writing this I am weeping). 

I think I moved myself through each of the sessions Dani and I had already done, recreating each one.

I moved to lay on the floor, vibrations were very intense. I could not get my legs to be comfortable, they were shaking. I asked for some support under my knees and Colleen offered me a blanket. Dani did what I’m guessing was energy work. I was drifting in and out of my sensations. Dani asked my to name the people I had placed on the alter. I said, “Jean and Charlie, mom and dad.” That was not good enough, it was just a mater of fact reciting of their names. I needed to deeper, Dani smacked my belly and said from here. I said, “mom?”. 

Dani instructed again. During this I was stuck in the sensations, I could not say the words. I could not feel into the words, I could think them, but not say them. My brain was busy tracking the touch of Colleen’s hand on my arm and shoulder. I was watching all of the visuals moving, I did a few experiments opening and closing my eyes, seeing how I could still focus, but there was a new overlay of prisms and rainbows. I was also aware that Dani was on the dark side of the room and Colleen was on the light side of the room. From that realization I started to think about all of the things that had come together to bring me to this point. It was only after this long diversion that I came back to fact that I was supposed to be saying something. Eventually I was able to say, “Why she’s not coming?”

Story time at the Alter

Dani asked me to tell a story about what was on the alter. I did not refuse but I did not have words for a story either, I simply went back into my head and noticed all sights and sounds around me,

Valley & I am willing

Sit bones on the floor - Music playing First Native American and then Asian 

As I was sitting on the floor Dani was talking to be about a bunch of things giving some additional reflections to me. I think this was when Dani was on my left, Colleen was right behind me. 

Themes that showed up during this trip.

I don’t know where my voice is

● When asked what I want or desire I go black, and reach into a void.

● I find all sorts of ways to avoid answering this question

● When I’m high I have limited access to words

I have developed powerful tools to get what I want without having to ask for it.

Question for Dani: When I got up to get some water, you commented saying he’s moving. What was happening at this time?
