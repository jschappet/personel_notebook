Reporting on my experiences with an Energy Weaver

  

2020 has been the year of edgy Jimmy, zero fucks will be given. To lean into this edgy side of myself I have begun exploring all kinds of different healing modalities, new experiences, and personal introspective work. One of these experiences started when I meet Dani, we meet at an Authentic Relating event at the beginning of the year. She has been an energy weaver for many years primarily working with women to heal the sacred feminine. However, she has been called to shift her focus to helping men heal and grow from traumatic pasts. I was to be a test client for her, together we would explore what this work would be like both for her as a practitioner and me as the client. When we started working together, I did not have a clear idea about what I was signing up for. I had done a little Reiki at the end of a yoga class, but never noticed any changes after the session.

  

To date Dani and I have completed 4 sessions, two in person sessions and two zoom call sessions. Because of the limitations imposed by COVID-19 we made do with Zoom calls, these were very effective in their own way, but I feel the in-person sessions were much more impactful for me. The session would go for 1.5 to 2.5 hours.

Each in-person session has had a little different flavor to them, but they each had a consistent flow. First there was some small talk and catching up. Then the session would begin with connection to me. This started with cuddling without words. Dani would then decide on the next steps for that session. We would move into that activity. And finally, we closed with discussion of what happened during the session as a recap.

  

## Session One: The rod in my heart.

  

After my mother passed away, I began seeking therapy, it started as couples counseling, and then after my divorce became individual therapy. During the therapy process I became aware of this pain/sensation in my chest that was very persistent. I tried to ask it what it wanted me to know and all kinds of therapeutic tools to look at what was going on with it. But as I tried to feel into it, it remained a mystery. It felt like a metal rod just behind my sternum about ½” in diameter and 2” long pointing into my chest. This rod became the focus of our first session. The session started with Dani and me sitting on the floor, I was leaning on her. She had a hand on my chest and one on my back. We stayed like this for 30 minutes, occasionally she would shift her hands from my chest to my head. During this process I was quiet, not saying anything but was noting thoughts and feelings that came up in me. When this part was completed, Dani explained to me that this rod in my chest did not want/need to be removed, but rather, that it was raw material that was to be transformed by my anger.

I have had quite the challenge with anger and conflict in my life. She asked me to shift to a lying down position, I laid on my back. Dani began moving her hands over my chest and belly. She was not touching me. During this process we were also talking through things that were coming up for me as thoughts or emotions. An idea started to form for me, I began to realize that I was afraid of anger, anger was unsafe. The expressions of anger I had seen caused people to be hurt. I had also continued the noting practice I had started earlier in the session. One thing I had noticed was that my heart rate was climbing, and my breathing had increased. My first instinct was to calm myself down. But since this rod was raw material meant to be transformed by my anger, then I should stoke the fire like a bellows. I allowed my breathing to increase, my heart rate continued to climb. At the peak of this energetic experience, I stopped thinking about anger and instead it became about power. It was not a little bit of power I was feeling in that moment either, the phrase that came up for me was, “THE POWER OF THE SUN”. This shift for me is critical, I’ve been afraid of anger and shutting down my power. The power of the sun, this gravitational force, I’ve been holding it back keeping it locked inside hoping no one would be hurt by it. As we wrapped this up, we completed with some time snuggling together talking about what had happened for me, giving me time to integrate the experience. The whole process took 2½ hours.

  

I have taken the information I learned about myself in this session out into the world. I have begun to see all of the places where I have been shutting down my anger, robbing myself of power to be myself, to be seen, and to attract the things I desire into my life. I have now found that the rod in my chest is not some broken part of me. It is actually a gauge that I can use to detect conflict in me and in my environment. And once I know that conflict is there, I can express frustration, anger or disappointment instead of burying inside myself.

Releasing the lower back pain. Key question: What happened when I was 12 years old?

  

  

## Session Four: Hips – Connected to Trauma Story

  

## Session Five: Telling my story

  

## Session Six: Connecting 2nd and 3rd Chakras

  

Following this session, I participated in a circle, the circle had a theme of grief and loss. During this circle I was present and supportive, but I was not being pulled into the pain others seemed to be experiencing. I felt a little outside the circle. During checkouts, one person singled me out. When they mentioned my name, I began an inhale. As they continued expression appreciation for me, I felt the warmth of it slide down me. The appreciation was smooth and buttery, I could sense it going over my heart and dropping into my belly. I had never before felt appreciation land for me in this way.

  

  

  

How do I know when I have achieved my goal of being more connected to self and dropped filters?

  

The first question to answer is now do I know I have filters installed? My working hypothesis is that I have created a set of filters to protect myself from becoming overwhelmed by sensory and emotional input and a set of filters that restrict my expressive output. The filters have served me very well to this point in my life. They have protected me and keep me safe; I am grateful for the ways that have served me. The output filters are easier for me to find and manage, I have been developing tools and awareness for places where I restrict what I say. However, my expressiveness is not limited to just words. One of the more intimate examples, is that I tend to be quiet during sex. It’s much more difficult for me to sense the input filters, I don’t really know what I am missing. If no one ever told you about chocolate how would you miss it. Through experimentation with marijuana, and some meditation, I have experienced hyper-focused senses and intense visualizations. I believe it is possible to experience this without the aid of pharmaceuticals.

  

They no longer serve me, I have new tools to manage feels, emotions, and expressiveness.

  

Maybe I don’t want to drop the filters, but rather, build better awareness and control of them. I will know I have achieved this goal, because I will have access to sensation and emotions with ease and comfort, I won’t have to concentrate or strain to connect to them. I will be aware of places that I am holding back or not letting things in and I will do this without being losing myself in the process.
