# What do I want out of the last few meetings with Greg?

Looking back on this experience I’ve have changed so much. I came into this coaching relationship wanting to find and explore some of my edginess. 2020 Was going to be the year of Edgy Jimmy, Zero Fucks to be given. Over the last three months I have explored many options of edginess from online circling, work with an energy healer, and Ecstatic dance all the way to naked yoga. Each of these experiences stretched, pun intended, me in ways.

Most importantly, I have invested in myself. I have spent time and money working to understand who I am, how do I show up in the world, what do I find interesting about myself and what do others find interesting about me. I’ve found that I have been afraid of expressing my anger. For a long time, I just thought I was calm, and things did not affect me, but really, I was afraid of expressing my anger, so I shut it down. In shutting down the anger I also shut down countless other emotions and feelings. I’m only just starting to tap into what impact this will have on my long term. But in feeling into my anger, I believe I can begin to harness a new power that I have had shutdown. The small fire of my anger that I have been hiding from is not small at all. When I start to look into it and feel the strength of it, it feels like the power of the sun. And in saying that, what I really mean to say is: THE POWER OF THE SUN!

The calm stillness that I have been afraid of displaying, can be embodied along with this planetary power. I can use this power to attract people, projects, money or whatever else I need to support me in my life. I have gravity. I don’t need permission, approval, or acceptance from the world. I can find each of those things in myself. As I have begun to explore this power in myself, I have been rewarded with opportunities that have come to me professionally, socially and romantically. None of opportunities were things that I was seeking out, but instead they found me. I believe this is my gravity working in the world. 

How do I lean into this newfound power, trust what the world is offering me, and give fully of myself? The only gift I can offer to the world is my presents. But I can offer it so fully that people feel the impact of it, that they trust the safety of my presents, and in that safety can rest and laydown some of their burdens. 

What do I want to explore, identify, or practice with Greg to develop better presence? Maybe the question to ask is what is the next thing getting in the way of me being present? What stops me from sharing my thoughts and feelings in the moment? In conflict I tend to collapse into myself, shutdown, and go inward to think, process and recover. This disconnects me from the present moment. Judgment we’ve talked about the inner critic, is there more there? Fear of punishment is this the same thing as judgment, just externalized?
