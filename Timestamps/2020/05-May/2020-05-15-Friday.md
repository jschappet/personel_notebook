I had an interesting circle the other day. The circle started with someone mentioning that they were missing physical presence of other people. During this check-in I shared the thought of missing being in physical presence. And I stayed with this thought, what did I really desire, and what I really wanted was to be able to hug someone. But not just hug them, but to see them from across the room without preamble or consent and go up to them and give them a big hug, Not in a romantic, more familial or friendly hug. As I spoke about this in the circle I was able to go one step deeper in understanding my desire, it’s not about the physical contact and connection, but instead it’s about have an intimate relationship with people that is so full of trust that I can be as rambunctious as a little kid running up to someone. My desire is to have close relationships that allow me to be rambunctious and affectionate with trust and acceptance.
