Patty took Mom to Charles region hospital with stroke like symptoms. 

They ran a few test, CT which shows possible stroke, they then did an MRI.

The MRI ruled out stroke.  They then determined they she needed to be transferred for more extensive diagnostic work to determine the cause of the aphasia.
