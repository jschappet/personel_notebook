Dr Porter stopped by again.

He mentioned that they may be treating the immunodeficiency with NEUPOGEN.

They may also be sending her home tomorrow. 

Neulasta or Neupogen?



Save on Administrative, Copayments, and Transportation Costs
If you're having weekly chemo and need frequent Neupogen shots, you can save in several ways. Ask your nurse if you can take Neupogen shots at home, and if so, have them train you or a family member on the proper way to give the injection. Be sure to carefully follow the instructions for storage, preparation, and injection. This will save you administrative costs, as well as copayments for each office visit, and transportation costs related to each shot. You will still have to visit your clinic for a regular CBC, to check your blood counts, with special attention to your neutrophil levels.
