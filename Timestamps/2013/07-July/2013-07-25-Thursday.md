# Note for 2013-07-25 (Thursday)

I just had lunch today with one of the people I look up to technically. He emailed me yesterday and asked if I would like to have lunch to discuss a job opportunity on campus. 

The job sounds interesting from a technical point of view and it seems like it would suit my skill set. However, I am leaning towards passing on this opportunity. I have committed to ICTS for the foreseeable future, and would not want to kill that relationship.
