# Note for 2013-07-22 (Monday)

Today was my first day back at work.  Lots of talking about what's going on in my life with Mom, and a little discussion of who will replace Ryan W. we are going to interview two candidates in addition to posting the job on job net. 

Audrey is still quite tired from her time at lucky Pawz. It was nice to get to ride the bike to work today, but I could still use so RPM therapy.
