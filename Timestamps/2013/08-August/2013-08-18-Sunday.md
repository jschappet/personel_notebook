# Note for 2013-08-18 (Sunday)

It's now time to worry about Audrey again. Today she decided to attack a kid that went running bye. The family was nice about the ordeal but this is now twice she has drawn blood from some one running bye. 

It is not like she has bitten people, but chasing down and scratching is still not cool.
