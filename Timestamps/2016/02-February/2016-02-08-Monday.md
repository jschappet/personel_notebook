# Note for 2016-02-08 (Monday)

We are heading home tomorrow. Is has been an interesting trip. I'm not sure if Tina is completely ready to embrace letting go. We had an fun time with a miss placed ice cube. As I woke up this morning, I had a very brief fantasy about Tina and Sarah switching swimsuits. I'm not sure any one else you have enjoyed it.
