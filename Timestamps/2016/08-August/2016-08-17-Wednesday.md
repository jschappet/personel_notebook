# Note for 2016-08-17 (Wednesday)

In three years I will be able to share thoughts and feelings without hesitation or doubt. My coaching practice will be in full swing, bringing more than enough income for me to thrive and give back. 

When asking Tina this morning where she wants our relationship to be in a year, the response was not good. I hope the later tonight, with Dr Sally we will be able to have a good conversation about it.
