Rivers

We all live our lives as rivers, the banks keeping us on track, always flowing the same way. But can a river change? Absolutely, they can be dammed or redirected. But more importantly, the river can change course on its own, slowly eroding one bank and adding to the other.  You can see this in rivers all over, they create small isolated Ox bow lakes, that are now disconnected from the main river. So when asked if people change, yes, yes they can change, but it takes time and diligence, slowly building good habits, eroding old ones, until the old is not longer part of the new streamlined you.
