## 1. **Is This a Permitted Investment?**

-  The investment is not a **life insurance contract** or **collectible** (unless exempt like certain coins or bullion).
    
-  The investment is not in an **S-Corp** (SDIRAs cannot own S-Corp shares).
    
-  The investment is not prohibited by **IRS rules (IRC 4975)**.
    
    - No sale, lease, loan, or service **between the IRA and yourself or disqualified persons**.
        
    - No direct or indirect personal benefit from the investment.
        

## 2. **Are There Any Disqualified Persons Involved?**

-  The investment does **not involve you**, your spouse, ancestors, lineal descendants (kids/grandkids), or their spouses.
    
-  It does **not involve entities** where you or these people own 50% or more.
    
-  It does not involve any **service provider** to the IRA (including yourself).
    

## 3. **Do You Have Proper Documentation?**

-  Purchase agreement, deed, private placement memo, promissory note, or equivalent.
    
-  Third-party appraisal or FMV documentation (required for reporting later).
    
-  Service agreement if using a **note servicer** or property manager.
    

## 4. **Have You Budgeted for Fees and Liquidity?**

-  Custodian fees (setup, transaction, annual, termination).
    
-  Enough **uninvested cash in the IRA** to cover:
    
    - At least 1 year’s custodian fees
        
    - Possible UBIT/UBTI tax (Unrelated Business Income Tax)
        
    - Administrative fees and required valuations
        

## 5. **Is This Investment Administerable by IRA Financial?**

-  You’ve submitted offering documents for **administrative review** (required for alternatives).
    
-  You understand they may **decline** to process assets for administrative reasons.
    
-  You understand **you bear the burden** of documenting the investment’s value and compliance.
    

## 6. **Have You Considered Tax Implications?**

-  If using **leverage (debt)**, are you prepared to track and file **Form 990-T** for UBTI?
    
-  If you’re planning a **Roth conversion**, you’ll need a **current valuation**.
    

## 7. **Is the Investment Account-Only?**

-  All transactions are **in the name of the IRA**, not you personally.
    
    - E.g., “IRA Financial Trust Co. FBO Jimmy Schappet IRA #XXXX”
        
-  You won’t mix personal and IRA funds or resources (even for something as small as mowing a lawn or driving to the land).
    

## 8. **Do You Have a Clear Exit Strategy?**

-  How will you eventually **liquidate** or distribute the asset?
    
-  If it’s illiquid (like land or startup equity), do you have other liquid assets in the IRA for:
    
    - Required minimum distributions (after age 73)
        
    - Emergency flexibility
