Youbell. We're talking about the deep play retreat and the different components of the deep play retreat that makes sense. And how we apply them to what is potentially an opportunity to lead a retreat at Christine's house. 
Yeah, I would like to figure out how to... We went to a retreat and it was welcoming. The power was talked about explicitly. 
There was role basically power, and then there was some ability for other people to rise up and take their own power. So I like to build structures for that. There was also rituals for choosing what we were going to do. 
So one of the rituals was to have everybody in the circle say what they would lead and then have each person in the room walk over to the one that they liked the best and put their hand on that person. So it was a way of voting together. And then the ones that did not win, we said goodbye to, and we warn't that we would never have the existence of this beautiful idea. 
Well, I want to pause here. I I love what you're talking about. I love the direction with it. 
And I want to vote I want to put a vote in for you as supreme leader for this project. That's fair. We don't have to move out of the power. 
I just want to be really explicit about where the power is, because that's a really big deal for me. Right. So what I'm suggesting is that you get to be the top for this project. and then I'm going to take direction from you and lead where you tell me to lead. 
Okay. And I would even, like, could be our part of our agreement with Christine, that she would like, have her roles and responsibilities in whatever space she wants. Like, we could negotiate with her and she could be supreme leader of the things that she wants to be supreme leader of. 
Right, but you get the container. Okay. And so with the container, what I want to do is is build a slowness, a listening to body, going the speed of body, letting the body be an antenna for a relationship and baby steps to expression and interacting. 
And you'll bring agreements that support that, and you'll bring time containers that support that you'll bring, what else will you bring? A way for people to bring up feelings or withholds or fears, and let them embrace them as they come into their room, like a languaging around how they they're not bad things. Like a. 
To have fears. Like all feelings have full merit and a flow to them. Yeah, what I'm hearing under that is even a sense for the creating the portal and the container that you're transitioning into to hold all of these feelings. 
Yeah, as if there are every single feeling is fully valid. And then is it possible to keep creating relationally? I don't know. 
It's interesting to look at like my desire to co-create or even like build things that are co-creative somehow. Like I'm wanting the magic of each human to have like its expression in the space. So, and then also having this idea of having control of the container is. 
Like something kind of. Something that I've remember that I liked about Dplay that I think you're pointing to right now is the everybody brought something of themselves. That Yeah. 
To contribute. That's actually has been showing up a lot in my, as I'm writing events. I was thinking like, if I had a women's group, I want everyone to bring their own tapestry. 
Like, so it helps me because I don't have to decorate everything, but it's also someone bringing something of their own to the space and like actually sharing it. And Well it's, it's's not just bringing something to put on the altar, but it's actually bringing yourself to the event. Like more of your home self, Right. 
Which really excites me. Like, I love the idea of having a tapestry to help decorate the room, having foods that are your favorite foods that we even go slow with in acknowledging and accepting. I really like the idea of having like regular. 
So when I used to go to retreats with my women's group, we always brought food and shared who got to cook each meal. So there was a head chef and then there was one or two sub chefs for each meal. And so that was really cool because everybody got to bring their own thing or the thing that they loved, but we didn't slow down to talk about what it felt like to share, maybe that internal shame around not being sure if everyone's going to like it, not being sure if I'm going to cook everything on time. 
Like there was just so much richness just in interacting with that simple thing. So what if there were like, even a mini birthday circle around the role as that's happening? That sounds so cool. 
Like even setting up the whole schedule of the day so they're like, wow, we have dinner in two hours. So we're going to stop everything and birthday circle, the head chef and find out where they're at and if they need any support. Oh, that would be beautiful. 
Like, I can feel the beauty of it. Like, that check-in right before you're going off to do this thing for all of us. What's going on for you right before you're transitioning to that? 
What are your worries? What are you excited about? what? 
What did you bring to Delight us with? Yeah, that sounds really beautiful. What are you petrified about? 
What do you need? Like, how many hands would be helpful? Like, how do you know if it's enough or if it's safe? 
Or, like, are you going to cook the rice or not? How can we tell if you need more help or less help? This is so beautiful. 
I feel a little overwhelmed. Like, just emotionally, that this going back to this simplicity, like just being more and more and more explicit, like even in deep play, we had so many transitions or so many like, whoa, what's it like to eat dinner together? You know, we didn't talk about any of that stuff. 
Like it was sort of extra. And I like the idea of actually using that like day to day activities to look at ourselves or look at each other or how we're relating to each other, like through the simple activities of a regular life, like picking or cleaning up or anything. We're taking the birthday circle into real life. 
Yeah, like stopping everything and bringing the birthday circle into real life. Yeah. But I also want a big section of it being like acceptance of self. 
So maybe some some journal entries, maybe some mirror work, like, you know, maybe as you come into the space, you know, everybody has a little mirror and you just look at yourself and maybe journal about what you say. Some of the templates you were talking about the other day. Yeah. 
Like, like, um, yeah, ways to reflect and also ways to. Would you want to to be the same one each day or a new one every day? It's hard. 
It seems like it could be both. Like there could be a morning one or a transition one, like different little rituals of checking in with yourself and finding out where you are. And then maybe even checking in with another person. 
Like maybe we have a two hour break and we have some kind of worksheet that's like check with one other person. Find a partner. Just because we're in the planning stage for something upcoming, what's the minimum viable product for you here? 
We got to create a little tiny bit of work. What's the minimum viable product we got to create? One page, three seven stems? 
This isn't really, I guess, but that's that's what I cannot answer that question. Like, I would need to, I think I would need to work on, you know, six different worksheets and different transitions or start mapping out transitions, maybe sit down and write out, you know, a whole workshop, you know, including meals and including, a whole weekend, a retreat. And then I also want to include some psychodrama because psychodrama is really exciting to me. 
So circling in psychodrama and then journaling and self-reflective work and then some partner work. So I have this whole vision for all of that. How tightly packed do you want the day? 
I do like the idea of having lots of breaks. So I don't actually want, I think the deep play structure was pretty good where it had, um, it had a breakfast and then an hour break and then a two hour thing and then a, you know, lunch break of two hours and then an afternoon thing for two hours and then another two hour break. I don't know how many days this adds up to, but just having, I guess three different things through the day, but like maybe the afternoon is just this thing where you're journaling and looking around for people.. 
So I have interesting questions coming up for me. How do you structure the out of context time in context time or like, there's going to be, like, I'm imagining transitions like want the the retreat is one context from beginning to end. But then we're going to have some in intense context time and out of intense to context time. 
Is there something like context that you would put in the big container to support? I don't know. This is an interesting question that we need to look into, but I don't actually have, I have no idea. 
Like, it was nice that the deep play retreat let all of the participants invent what they wanted to do in the evening. So there were board games or improv games or like Christine's house has pool time. What do you think of what would your intention be for that time? 
Well, integration and feeling freedom and like the freedom to explore what feels right to you at the end of the day. Right.. I'm not sure. embracing. kind of self acceptance or honoring self. 
Honoring like the co-creation of play, like of rest? The co-creation of rest.. works That's a really good. We work hard. 
How do you want to rest? Yeah, but like the co-creation of the rest. Or how do you want to integrate? 
So the deep play retreat, we made little agreements like, oh, let's all go put our feet in the stream. Or, oh, I really want to be alone now. So I'm going to go wander off into the forest or Yeah. 
But staying in connection... Not necessarily. I mean, it might be a long time that one needs. 
Right, right. But you can stay in connection in alone time by letting people know where you're going and when you're coming back. Right. 
That makes sense. So I would say an intention towards connection with self-care and mind or something, but. Yeah, that sounds great.. 
Okay, I think I needed part two of this conversation, because I feel a little bit flooded. We could start practicing this now by circling each other, having a birthday circle for each other, at the point, different points throughout the day, like, what's my relationship to food right now? What's my relationship to the mess on the table right now? 
What's my relationship to Shapet or my children right now? Do you have other ideas? This is your role right now that you're in. 
Roles. What is it like to be in that role right now? More explicit roles. 
Ooh, we could even come up with soft tender rolls, like I'm being the listener right now. Or I'm being the expressive one that's entertaining everybody right now. So we could play with, is it just birthday circling or is it like also. 
I want to bring in more psychodrama, but I need some suggestions. The one that I've done is where, which was really beautiful, and I think we could definitely lean into that, but where there's 10 people in a group and one person gets up and they start telling different parts of their brain that they're aware of, like as it's happening. It was such a fun game. 
Yeah. So I'm feeling scared and then I start acting out the scared part and then someone who feels inspired by that, stands up and becomes that part of my brain, and then I step into the next part of my brain and start acting it out when someone else starts acting that part of my brain out. And then to see how many parts of your brain show up, maybe like four, five, six, and then step back and maybe everybody slows down a little bit. 
You're allowed to interact with the different people or ask them to act a different way or ask them to interact with each other, the different parts of your brain in a different way. But I really want to slow that down and maybe even spend like a whole afternoon doing it with everyone. So that seems like that would be a long process. 
I love, for some reason, I am. I'm in the roles mindset. I don't know why, but, like, doing that psychodrama the moment, somebody's getting up to go do their support support thing. 
Oh, so tucking in, not just birthday circles, but also psychodrama as we're doing the day. So if you did the psychodrama during the day thing, like, okay, I'm getting ready to do this thing. Like, quick, somebody come here and do this. 
And then, because I'm split between eight different things that I want to do right now.. Or even, you know, at the deep play retreat, I would feel a little bit overwhelmed. My nervves would feel overwhelmed, and I would get up and walk out. 
And it seems kind of fun to, like, find that part of me in a relationship to the group. So I'm walking out and moving away from the group, I'm getting out of that situation. But, like, what if that part was even welcome? 
It had a little bit more voice. Like, oh, you see, you're leaving. Let's spend 10 minutes finding out how you are right now, and everything about you is great. 
Like, there's all acceptance. Yeah. Oh, there's... 
And even appreciation from the people, maybe? Well, and I would not want to say, let's spend 10 minutes. Let's say, is there anything.. 
Like, there's a. I don't want there to be a half to. If somebody's trying to leave to go find quiet. 
Yeah, that makes sense. I understand that. I have to. 
But I think that the five or ten minutes, so maybe we need to so we would have a languageaging, like, does five minutes feel okay? Does 10 minutes feel okay? Do you want zero minutes right now? 
And then accept the person's choice. So it's almost like hang up like, oh, I notice you're doing something. Here's my little car that says five minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes. 
Or even just attention. Yeah. But, but I like the idea of knowing there's a start and an end. 
So like, if we interrupt something else, then we know we're interrupting it for five minutes or for 10 minutes. So that's why I'm liking the, the like, the way of communicating to everybody, this disruption is going to. We'll have to play with this a bit because I don't know if that much disruption. 
Like we'll have to find something stable like as the spine of what we're doing and then figure out how much disruption is sort of like makes you feel sick or makes you feel okay. because if we're disrupting everything all the time to like focus on one person, I mean, is it better just to structure the entire day around food or like something like this? And then actually just do different circles throughout the day as we're doing those things. I'm not sure. 
I don't know if it's too disruptive. Oh, the big. The big thing that's coming up for me is I want people to be aware of the impact they're having on my nervous system. 
Hmm. So you want other people to be aware of their impact? And do you also want to be aware of how you're impacted, right? 
I definitely want to be aware of how I'm impacting other people. Oh, impacting other people. But how you're impacted, then you can make different choices. 
Right. And so, like. So I think I'm looking for some sort of intention for connection and honoring of him, like honoring of nervousous systems. 
Right? So I think part of what you're pointing to is the signaling of like, my nervous system is going out of control. I'm gonna. 
I'm gonna care for it if Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go sit in this care place, and somebody who wants to care can meet you there and you can say, nope, or yes. I actually had, when I was thinking about this the other day about retreats, I was thinking that one of the things I wanted was like to give everybody three ribbons, I think it was. 
And then one was, I want to be alone, but please come talk to me. One was, I want to be alone, but I don't, I want everyone just to leave me alone right now. And then another one was maybe like, I really want to be part of the group. 
I don't know. But so that way you could actually signal to people without having to, I noticed that I, it's sometimes at those tender points, I don't really want to signal.. Like, I want people to leave me alone sometimes. 
Well, it's kind of the. Like... I need support, but I don't know how to ask for it. 
Well, that would be like, I want someone to come and find me, which I think would be neat to say. But I think even, so for me, I start feeling nervous when I want to leave this space. Like, this is one of the reasons I freeze during improv is that I need to do something different than everybody else and I feel some shame that I have to do something different. 
And then that ends up in this self-judgment loop where I just start freezing and freezing and freezing because I can't find safety in my own needs. And what does that signal to other people? Like, what do you How do you want other people to respond to that?, what I really want people to do when I take myself out of the situation, I mean, a lot of the time, I want them to say, awesome, you're so awesome. 
I love that you just decided to do your own thing. Yay. You know, just like a lot of acceptance. 
Because I do feel weird for doing stuff different from everybody else. But I actually, to take care of my nervous system, I can't do what everybody else does. So being able to communicate it better feels like it's like almost like that like predisclosure thing to like, I can like, like I think that's what I have to do at improv to be able to get through this at all is just to stand up and say, I'm going to sit down and you all need to leave me alone and I am perfectly happy. 
I just have this weird way of my nervous system is just different. I can't just go along and I just have to find my yes and my nose super slow. And maybe that seems weird. 
Does anybody think that's weird? Okay, because I'm a little worried it's weird. And when I get worried it's weird, it gets even heavier for me. 
So I want to say that to the improv group. And then it just seems so like deep and emotional and like too much for them because they're all like, for play! Mr. Fix it here. 
That would be a fantastic monologue to just, like... Oh, no, I've imagined it many, many times. I think it's a fantastic thing to deliver, even. 
Yeah, I've been wanting to. I just. I just You're a little semiircle. 
I'm going to do a performance piece. Yeah.. Yeah. 
Yes, I know. Okay.
