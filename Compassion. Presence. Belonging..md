When I thing of compassion presence and belonging my heart is filled. it is cracked open. The pain I hide from those closest to me, is just the medicine I need to heal.

When I hide my pain away from the world I am separating myself. I've gotten so good at hiding my pain, I can even feel it myself. I try to put my attention on it, and my mind just goes blank. My body just feel completely foreign to me. The only clues I have are a dull ache in my chest that never leaves. When I get a little attention my heart crumples and I get teary. What must have happened to so many of us that we must hide our pain? 

Are feelings so scary that we all run from them? Maybe, I'm just imagining that everyone is like me, I'm afraid to feel my feelings. I need help, mirroring, acceptance and trust to feel my feelings. That is such a tall order. How can I expect anyone, any one, to be able to hold all of this for me. Could I possibly be worth all of this effort and attention? 

Yes, this is what belonging is, me being exactly as I am, and those around me seeing me with compassion and presence. And my job is to see them the same way. For me here, I go into imagining them feeling, pain or sadness, or happiness. My heart relaxes, I feel a bright smile warm my face.

My intention is to see people where they are, and find my feelings inside, so that my pain, my feelings can be reflected, seen bringing me into belonging.
