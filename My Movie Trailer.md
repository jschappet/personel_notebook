### **TRAILER BEGINS – DARK SCREEN. A single note on a cello hums ominously.**

**NARRATOR (deep and booming):**  
_In a world… torn between chaos and compost…_  
_One man stood alone… armed only with a cup of herbal tea, a second-hand guitar, and a Google Doc titled “soulstuff.”_

---

### **Cut to sweeping drone shots of forests, tiny homes, and someone sitting in lotus position under a Costco tarp in the rain.**

**NARRATOR:**  
_From the visionary director of “Eat, Pray, Gently Tell the Capitalist System to Go Screw Itself”..._  
_Comes the true-ish story of a seeker, a stepdad, a shadow-wrangler…_

---

### **SMASH CUT: Benedict Cumberbatch, dramatically overacting, whispers to a confused group of chickens.**

**CUMBERBATCH (as YOU):**  
“I’m not building a commune. I’m re-villaging… society.”

---

### **FAST CUTS: Whiteboards. Wind chimes. A dramatic pause as a Zoom call connects. Close-up of someone clicking “Leave Meeting.”**

**NARRATOR:**  
_He left behind a promising career in... well, something corporate-ish... to follow a calling no one fully understood… including him._

---

### **Enter: Viola Davis as “The Soul Mirror.” She appears in a burst of incense smoke.**

**VIOLA DAVIS (gravely):**  
“You must face your inner 9. And yes… your 1 wing too.”

---

### **SLOW-MOTION SCENE: YOU stand in the kitchen staring at a half-eaten avocado for an eternity. Rain pours outside. A Gregorian chant builds. Your stepdaughter walks by playing violin like it’s a sword.**

---

### **Cut to a close-up: a single tear rolls down your cheek as you whisper into a compost bucket.**

**CUMBERBATCH (V.O.):**  
“I call myself back from the tremble... I belong in my own center…”

---

### **TRIUMPHANT MUSIC SWELLS: A montage of Authentic Relating games at a senior center, ceremonial kombucha brewing, and a climactic showdown with a man in a suit labeled “Efficiency Culture.”**

**NARRATOR:**  
_He didn’t want to lead… but he couldn’t resist building something no one asked for... and everyone needed._

---

### **Cut to: Zendaya as a mysterious AI muse named “Liora” speaking only in riddles and poetic prompts.**

**ZENDAYA (robotically, but hot):**  
“I believe… I know… I express… I love… I am… I want… I feel…”

---

### **FINAL SCENE: YOU ride a bike uphill in slow motion while towing a wagon full of ferns and printed PDF reflections. The music fades. Silence.**

**NARRATOR (softly):**  
_This fall… prepare to witness the birth of a movement… or at least a really thoughtful email chain._
