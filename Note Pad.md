I am alive
I want attention and acceptance
I feel pressure writing this list
I love. Full stop.
I express subtly
I know my values
I believe there is a higher power in the world

I feel meloncholy
I want to feel this and other emotions fully as they arise
I am present and aware 
I love with an open and expansive heart
I express sadness freely
I know emotions are safe and normal
I believe owning meloncholy I will have access to other emotions



I feel  
I want
I am   
I love 
I express 
I know 
I believe 

Experience is a myriad richness:

We think more than we can say;

We feel more than we can think;

We live more than we can feel. 

And there is much more still.

Here’s the sharing dissonance framework - feel free to share it with the Monday group if it serves! 1. Welcome it - Create space for any uncomfortable feelings in yourself

2. Frame it  - Express your motivation for sharing it

3. Get Consent - If it’s about someone specific and you want to explore it with them, ask if they are willing to hear about your experience*

4. Soften it - Start with a less charged feeling word and/or name body sensations

5. Own it - Give context. What from your own world does this bring up for you?

6. Check impact - with an individual and/or the group
