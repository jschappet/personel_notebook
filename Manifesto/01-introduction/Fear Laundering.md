Fear laundering is the process by which raw, primal fear is converted into socially acceptable power, influence, or profit — much like money laundering cleans dirty cash. In fear laundering, institutions, media outlets, or individuals take vague or exaggerated threats, amplify them, and repackage them into narratives that justify control, loyalty, or consumption. The original fear — often irrational or manipulative — is “washed” through layers of legitimacy: expert opinions, patriotic framing, moral outrage, or public safety. By the time it reaches the public, it’s no longer recognized as fear mongering, but as truth, policy, or common sense.
