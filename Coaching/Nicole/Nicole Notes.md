I invite you to complete the following sentence starters. Maybe think about them at three levels or perspectives, Coaching business, Family, and Self.

Today I am celebrating… 

Coaching: had a very productive TCM call yesterday on my mindset about starting a FB group.

Family: We’re having a girl!!!!!!!!

Self: I’m starting to feel more organized internally and less like a frazzled mess.

My positive outlook on COVID-19 is...

Coaching: almost everyone is emotionally eating and could use support in those regards!

Family: having Justin home is so nice!!

Self: having Justin home gives me time to rest and take care of myself.

Optional: I feed my adventure by…

We’ve been getting to know our town better by just driving around areas we didn’t know. It’s been really fun!

Moving forward I want to focus on … 

I’m not totally sure...there’s still a lot of overwhelm, especially now that we’re throwing moving in the mix. But I also think that’s to be expected with everything on my plate. I’m extremely hesitant on moving, but I think that’s just critter brain. So maybe start there??

March 1st, 2020

I invite you to complete the following sentence starters. Maybe think about them at three levels or perspectives, Coaching business, Family, and Self.

Today I am celebrating… 

Coaching - signing my first non-friend/family member client and her paying in full! Also, a very successful talk at a local kickboxing studio.

Family - positively conversing with my brother and his wife.

Self - resting without feeling guilty, getting a massage, really attempting to not be so hard on myself for not physically being able to stick to my normal healthy diet.

The action step I took that I’m most proud of is…

Coaching - Committing to a 6 week intensive that is designed to help new(ish) online businesses succeed, following through and creating OTR’s from my talk.

Family - making myself reach out to my brother and his wife

Self - scheduling 2 more massages, taking stuff off of my schedule so that I am well prepared for my 6 week intensive.

Moving forward I want to focus on … 

Coaching - for now, putting 100% effort into the 6 week intensive.

Family - doing my best into giving Levi some extra 1:1 and family attention since he will be an only child for only 6 more months.

Self - continuing with self-care, explore new options for self-care, more personal development books.

February 18th, 2020

I invite you to complete the following sentence starters. Maybe think about them at three levels or perspectives, Coaching business, Family, and Self.

Today I am celebrating… 

Coaching - completing a ton of OTR’s with complete strangers, preparing for a talk, committing to being a part of a “think tank” for creating a wellness event.

Family - a fun 3 day weekend with my family! Having a productive, in-depth conversation with my husband about our family’s future.

Self - taking some time this weekend to rest!

The action step I took that I’m most proud of is…

Coaching - stepping out of my comfort zone and doing OTR’s with strangers, one being international. 

Family - having an in-depth conversation with my husband about our family's future.

Self - allowing myself to rest and take a nap without feeling guilty or shameful.

Moving forward I want to focus on … 

Coaching - a little more networking in my local community, creating a FB group so I can build an online community, block scheduling

Family - block scheduling so that family time is family time and not interrupted with work. More date nights/days with Justin.

Self - more (and different) intentional self-care! Schedule a massage.
