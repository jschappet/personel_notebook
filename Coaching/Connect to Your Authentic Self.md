 
“Look at you! Getting your work done on time for once,” Alissa, Mark’s boss said.

Mark felt bristley and instantly defensive.  He was about to shout out, “what the hell is that supposed to mean?” But stopped himself just in time. Instead, he felt small. He felt like he disappeared somehow.

Obviously, Mark was triggered. He did not understand why he was instantly upset by Alissa’s comment.

I have been working with people like Mark using my training and background in Health and Wellness Coaching to help clients better identify and navigate these triggers. 

In response to this need, I have developed a streamlined program where clients can receive the same quality services, but in a small group and accelerated setting.

(Do you get triggered easily, overreacting to other people’s comments or behaviors? Do you want to respond better—from a more grounded and centered place?)

This program includes 10 weekly sessions to develop your internal awareness of each of the 8 Cs of being grounded. The intention of this program is to show you how to move away from triggered reactions and better respond from your grounded self. Each session will focus on one of the attributes of Grounding: Confidence, Calmness, Creativity, Clarity, Curiosity, Courage, Compassion, and Connectedness. 

The program will be offered as one-on-one coaching or small groups (4-5 people).

- One on one coaching is $2,500

- Small group is $600/person
