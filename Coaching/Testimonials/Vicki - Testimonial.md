I worked with Jimmy as a health coach for 90 days. Jimmy worked with me to create actionable tasks each week. Each week I completed, I felt empowered and more conscious of my decisions. Throughout the process I rediscovered myself as a former athlete and was empowered to regain my strength. He helped me gain awareness of the things that were holding me back from achieving my goals. I sometimes lacked confidence in my ability to do more and often self sabotaged and Jimmy helped me feel like I could and deserved to be successful. I would recommend him to anyone that feels stuck in their life or needs accountability with their health goals. It was the best investment I made in myself. â€“ Vicki
