Hello.. Are these little guys? What are they?  Is this one of the apples? No. I don't look like apples.  No, wasn't this weird apple either. It has an apples on it. Yeah.  Not ready.. The first apples are ready at the beginning of August, I think. Aren't there spring apples that come in?  No. If he got the I sent him an individual Instagram and it worked, but the phone message didn't work. Oh, the lady today was talking too about how relational.  You. divergent. She's talking about ADHD, but how like other people can be hyeri independent and not be. It's true.  That lady. Oh, that lady ran in today on Will, whooop. She wrote something on Substock, that lady that I said that I felt.  Like I keep seeing the same echo of the same thing. Like, so now that I've got it in my mouth, I'm seeing the echo of this new world, this perceptive. So she was saying I I read this..  Give us the thumbnail of the new world. I'll try. Well, this lady was saying she read the book that we have that says ADHDs, hunters in a farmer's world.  And like the gathering in the hunting. And so she was putting forth that the hypersensitivity, incrediblyible like empathy and high relationality and high demandful truth of she was saying ADHD is a set of skills needed for a new hyperation, like relationship relational, like a new world, like, honest and connected.. I don't know.  I guess I'd have to read it again. I don't think she said. I don't remember what she said about like what to do next or like what this world looks like.  But the lady that I was reading, oh, actually, she did. She was talking about connection to the earth. And I think even consciousness itself.  Yeah, so I've been, the reels that I've been getting fed are like, we We are souls. We don't have souls. We are souls.  And this flesh body is like a shirt. Yeah, but it's also like a strait jacket and like, I really think it's important to be actually like as embodied as possible. Right.  Because like learning on this planet is about being totally embodied in like the body antenna because that's what we're supposed to do here. Yes. So it doesn't really matter.  It's okay if we lose an arm or whatever. Like, I mean, kind of. like any hardship just lets us do our life work. Right, because we're we're here, we're here for, as somebody so eloquently put it, Fruit and fucking.  And like the feeling of this life. Okay, but.. So.  I guess I'm also, like, I'm not going to reduce it just to that, right? Is that Well, I mean, there's... But experience, I mean, essentially it's experiencing life in everything that it has to offer us..  Well, so, I've been into password lately. And in password. We're actually here to do the work of refining our soul.  So, like, going back to forgiveness, going back to kindness, going back to spreading happiness, going back to caring for others. Like, all of that is like kind of the, I guess sort of the putting down of e ego, okay, in Patrick, I called the lower self and embracing the higher self. which I guess that just means that that you can use your body antenna more cleanly if you are in your higher self. Mm.  So. Like the undefended and un trigger. Yeah.  Like, that's like, I think that's what keeps you in torment. So accepting that we're not entitled to a perfect life.. And we're pully responsible for this life.  Those are all sort of passwords things, like reasons why we're. Yeah, those seem very much in line with me. the things I'm talking about as well. Hmm.  Like, I mean, it is a bit reductionary to call it just the two things, but it's, you know, about experiencing what White House has to offer, and all of that's been co-opted by our friendly capitalist systems. Well, yeah, not having each other, like, not supporting each other is the biggest problem. You know, it is kind of interesting.  Like, one thing, you know, in Native tribes, they were very, like, freeloaders were very alarming to them. So, not because they wanted to get something out of you, but because the rest crocity meant survival, right? You just can't have, you know, the hen grow the wheat and thresh the wheat and sow the wheat and all that.  And then serve everybody. It just doesn't it's not to survive it. It's not.  And you lose connection. So I wonder if that's actually something maybe that's the thing that's kind of in my family where everybody's like, wait, you have to pace something. I mean, the problem is when you know, did you, I mean, it's fine.  Whatever. But my mom actually prioritized helping you. Like, she never offered me coffee, but she got you coffee, like, a couple of times.  So I'm not, I don't know. And, like, you were doing a job. I just really felt like it was like, oh, because I was washing dishes when she offered you coffee.  And I was like, okay. But I think, anyway. So there's also sexist stuff happening in there, too.  I mean, there's probably a number of a number of things at play being the new person, a bit of sexism, a bit of.. just wanting to look good. Probably a very mult multifaceted Maybe. To me, you were the one that needed to be served.  But... And I don't think it was about a guest thing, actually. I think it was like, because you were doing anything.  Like, she expected me to do stuff, but you, she didn't expect as much from, probably because you were male. And so. I think she was paying you back for all of your efforts or something.  Anyway.. I guess I said I didn't care, and I kind of didn't care, but I think it was some part of me that's like, okay, like, all right, I'm going to put that down. I don't need to expect my mother to want to get me a cup of coffee.  Just because.. It's sort of odd that she's offering you coffee multiple times. Mysterious white sign.  Do you want to know what it says? Sort of. Sort of not.  Ooh. A lost dog laminated. Oba and Sadie.  Two of them? Yeah, they look like Dobermans. It says, don't chase. puppies.  The air feels like a really perfect temperature right now, doesn't it? Yeah, it's a little cold for me. Ooh.  I. I'm surprised. A little too serious. Oh.  I to my phone because I was Quintin was reaching out and then I never really learned why.. So. I think I asked him why and he did not answer.  It's okay.. Thank you for saying you believe I'm important to your well-being and I'm not sure if that's the kind of important that I want to be. Does that make sense?  Yeah, I actually feel kind of annoyed. Like you're reducing by thing to something you don't want. What the fuck?  It's not the right thing. Okay. I feel unseen.  I felt a little mixture of like anger and fear. Like my expression of care wasn't enough. How did you hear it?  Like, what was this, what's this thing that you don't want? I have my own, sort of related to my childhood of being you know, seen as being useful. And that's why I was loved. as opposed to just being a full person.  So you think I might just love you for being useful? No, that is not what I said. You said that the way that I expressed love wasn't how you wanted to be loved.  No. Also, not what I said. I see.  What I was saying is that I have a a bit of. like I want I want to be wanted in addition to being needed, and I'm not saying that you don't do that. But I have activation in my system, around the like being around that being needed thing because of my childhood stuff... It's like I couldn't tell what it was.  It's a rabbit. Hi, Bonnie. Hey, Glen.  Hello, um. Could I get your opinion on something? Sure.  Hold up. Show me this is here. I'm gonna share my screen, my bill.  Do you see my screen? No. I don't?  No. Oh. I'm might in a minute minute, but I might.  I wonder, what are you showing me, sweetie? Oh, there it is. Oh, is it a conversation?  Okay. Okay, wait. That's a pretty picture.  What are we doing, sweetie? I'm gonna walk. Can you tell me what we're Can you give me the scope of this, darling?  What are you asking me, sweetie? It looks to be the only Instagram an Instagram I can't use this Discord. Yeah.  Or this or. So I understand that this limitation in me doesn't allow all of the appreciation that you're wanting to share with me to land. Yeah.  And it makes sense that you would you would feel unseen in that. because all of you're heaping lots of appreciation in my direction. and if it doesn't have anywhere to land over here, then.. Yeah. And it didn't feel like I was saying I need you because you're useful.  I felt like I was saying I need you because this bond is like.. a huge part of my world that I've chosen.. Like, it's both super essential, but also Yeah, when I was looking at, I wasn't thinking about you being used. So, yeah, I don't, yeah, I still feel a little anxious and, like.  I'm not going to be understood and, like, there's no, like, I don't know what to say. I might even have a thing that's like, oh, my care's not landing, let it go, let it go, let it go. Ballast!  Like.. Something. Like, I guess it's scary for me for my reach to not land..  It kind of appears we have like a double wound here. because I have a wound around reaching towards others.. I think those are snakes or mice or something's rough with rustling in the bushes. I heard four different rustells.  Wow. Wow. Just right there.  Did you not hear them? I remember. Maybe it was two two of each.  Yeah. In the battle for life and death. The hunter and the hunted.  One of those sticky spots that makes being in relationship so hard, huh? hell. Going to the driveway.  The part of me that was falling asleep during those circles now, remembering tired.. I was tempted to stop at the sign on the way down, but didn't say anything. What a nice pink over on that side of the sky.  Telephone pole One of the other reels I saw today was fucking about the I don't. The intergalactic beingings are gonna prevent World War III because World War III would be too dangerous for the higher dimensions. with like have ripple effects said. different dimensions. So they won't won't let that happen.  Well that the dowsing rod girl talk about that?. Ask that question. I do like like how true all that stuff feels or like even feeling into myself when she asks the questions.  I get my own internal. Uh-uh, uh- uh sense. This is around like five minutes of cardio.  I have an hour walk. I know, but we don't have a fast heart rate except for this part, you? I don't.  I think my heart's going to go whatever. My poor mom, I told her that I think I was work for going such a slow pace. She's like, what?  I was like, it's just so different from my pace that I... That makes sense that you would be sore from that. Yeah, it was like going in slow motion.  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was doing the whole time.  Like, yeah. Oh wait, let's look at the. Oh, I can't see it.  I'll have to go the next. Next. Viewpoint.  Oh, the thing is stripping. So clean this all up, pull out all the underneath things, and then just put walls on there. Put insulation in there.  No drums will see us. Could build a bunker for like 200 people in here. They'd notice that.  We would start wanting to park cars places and Yeah, I would get very busy. Cal still more interested in wicking the truck than eating the hay. them cows seem to be gone. I know.  At least we didn't have to see them go. Why don't you do it down here by yourself? Hey, bud.  We could come say hi to you, but... You're just gonna run away. Yeah, I don't think you want to say hi to us.  Hi. Hi. Is there anything you want me to know, Kat??  Can you please? It's kind of dirty, though. There's no good grass.  Hmm? You don't think they want to clover? I want to hurt you.  I'm sorry. Looks like all splattered, is all. But maybe they don't care.  M c. It's of dangerous to stare into the cow's eyes. How come?  No, I'm going to be like.. I fure them. Yes, and the sadness of imprisonment.  They're imprisoned. out of the rightful order of things. Like, why don't they at least let them in the field and they can feed them over there? I mean, come on.  I don't know. I have nothing. It's nothing wrong with eating cows.  It's just treating them badly on the way.. The butcher used to butcher the goat, and the goat would be sitting there happily, and then they'd slice the neck open. The goat had no idea what just happened.  All of a sudden it was no more. Yeah. Yeah, they apparently, when they're butchering them, like like doing major processing, they have a like just a a pneumatic, almost like a big nail gun, except it doesn't fire a nail, it just fires a rod.  It just May I go so quickly? I. May I go in the way that and then to go. I've probably told you this before, but I have the motorcycle shop I like to frequent have a T shirt that said I want to die quietly and my sleep like my grandfather did, not screaming like a passenger in a side car.  Oh. Yeah. Hop Hop seem to have a pretty good pretty good death..  What do you mean? What do you at the end of his life, he was like eating a cup of cream soup and an insure. And that was his food for the day and eventually he just stopped eating that as well.  He didn't really have a major illness or anything? Yeah. Kind of wild both your parents died so young.  They really did, and seemingly both in pretty good health before they had a major medical term. How long left your mom does your dad die? Mom died in 2014 and dad died in 2018..  Do you think theirs was a marriage that was supposed to figure it out or something? Like, is that such thing exist? Like, if they'd figured it out, they could have helped each other, then... maybe not.  It's really tough to say with their marriage. They. They had issues between the two of them.  I don't think my dad had a problem that he couldn't avoid. Sounds pretty annoying. I think your mom ended up having to.  So the problem is when there's a power vacuum like that, is that the woman will stand up because he you got. done.. So then you've got a polarity problem, and I don't know how do you get back to where you're supposed to be. Yeah.  Well, and their dynamic, it was you know, sort of a. Right. She resented him for, I mean, you know, I'm sure her behavior, like it's like.. uncciously or unconsciously.  She fed into his problem avoidance. Well, I think what happens, I mean, I think this is what happened in my.. old relationship, but is that right, like you try and try and try and the resentment builds and bills and builds because the other person isn't stepping up. And so.  Although, I wonder why, like, on the other hand.. Like, when I think of my life, it was so stressful because I had been near diverse kids and I had so many of them and there was so much violence and haunts had all the violence from South America.. But maybe just, you know, fixing the garbage disposal or whatever., She's like, I know I'll get zapped if I hi.  What's up, Paisley? I know. If I go any clotheser, but I want to play with you.  When do they have a garden? Zucchis.. Many, many, many times.  I heard even listening to to Dave Ramsey Show in relationships like the man would lose his job. She would continue supporting the relationship, and he would just go into like a big downward spiral depression because so much worth was tied up in, what do I what I do? Like wasn't able to not flexible or like hasn't faced that or like hasn't figured out some deeper.  Yeah. Job loss is a pretty good way to killer a relationship. I think the even more surefired way would be to lose a kid.  I kind of feel like, like, so. I'm, like, noticing this, like, these subtle shifts with us, and it feels to me like it's, like, like, there's part of me that gets a little bit scared. Like, is it leaving dating?  Is that bad, you know? Like, as if the excitement of dating is the... Not that I can't still be in that mode, but that's the part that I'm like, oh, like, I don't, I feel nervous, but, um but the thing that's being created has this, like.  It's almost like a spiritual entity that's kind of here with us or something. Like there's it's like a texture to it that has a depth to it and like a such a beautiful feeling to it. I guess I need to let go of my fear around that and kind of just embrace the Maybe I should talk to you about the fear or something.  Oh. I don't think we need trash in the drain. Well, here, we'll take this one too. put it in here?  Huh.. It looks like somebody kind of piled up. Somebody cleaned up a bit over here.  You're a little bit there. That's the plant, yeah. That is probably not the best one.  There's a bunch in the yard. Sarah, this is a bit silly, but maybe if we pick up six of them at a time,.. Eventually get them back.  Macroplastics. There's some microes in here, too. these people agree that it's recycling day. I need to figure it seemed like then I was talking to Anne that maybe I'm not taking good enough care of my nervous system.  I'm just kind of getting mad at it for not being able to do everything, I think. I think that's Cartoon. Oh, Sunboxs are back. were a hit..  Who was it? Was it Eric saying? Eric said he wished he hadn't bought it stuck from the farmer's market 'cause it was too expensive.  Does this this is nonprofit that's just. Yeah, I think that's. We could say return to sender or something.  Well, because eventually they would say, oh, we should stop sending to them. Aren't they? That lady is dead.  She has taken off this shirt, meat suit. I was hearing about a near death experience today, and the lady apparently was in surgery. They were removing an aneurysm or something..  So they drained the blood out of her head. dropped her body temperature to like 6 degrees. Nice. Did the work. restarted her heart and. and she said that she reported sort of being out of her body, watching the surgery, and then like reported on surgical details.  Wow. Right. And so, like, as I'm hearing that, the Over here, the news the news that I get from that is our consciousness is not in our brains.  These guys, see, there's all these ones. This plant. Just one?  Yeah. You'll break it off pretty freely, and then you really want that or that. Yeah.  And it's horrible.. Is there a good way to, like, milk it without getting all of the. I don't know.  That's disgusting. How much do you need? I don't know a rice size.  Not much. Oh. So if you take this guy and plant it, you get a whole not tomato plant.  Oh, the top of it? The The sucker.. Here, let's try it.  Well, Where are we gonna plant it? Well, we got to root it first. Oh, okay.  Because you don't supposedly don't want the suckers in here. I think that's the only one we got, really. More tomato plants.  All right. Get them rooted.. What's up, little doodle?
