## I. The Quiet Kingdom of Jimmy

Long ago, in a quiet kingdom on the edge of the eastern sea, there lived a man named **Jimmy**. He was known in his village for his calm demeanor, his gentle voice, and his knack for fixing things that others had given up on. But Jimmy carried a secret ache—a tremble in his chest that came not from chaos, but from the slow erosion of his own presence.

He moved carefully through his life, a watcher from the edges. Love passed through his hands like water. Friendships surrounded him but never quite embraced him. He wondered, often in silence, if he had missed some secret invitation everyone else seemed to receive.

Still, he worked. He showed up. He loved with a kind of quiet loyalty that no one could quite name but many relied on.

But one day—after a long night beneath a sky that offered no answers—Jimmy made a vow. It was the year of *Edgy Jimmy*. The year of no more silence.

He would leave the quiet kingdom and seek out his fire.

## II. Trials of the Inner World

Jimmy's journey took him across strange and vibrant lands.

He danced barefoot with wild souls under moonlight. He sat in dark rooms and let strangers hold space for his rage. He cried. He circled. He stood naked, literally and metaphorically, to let the shame peel away.

And through it all, he kept asking—not of others, but of himself:

> *Where have I gone?*

Until one day, in the stillness between breaths, Jimmy found something ancient stirring in his belly. Not rage. Not grief.

**The Sun.**

The fire he had spent decades hiding from was not an enemy—it was *his engine*. He felt it rise up through him, not to destroy, but to illuminate. His anger was not a storm—it was gravity. His presence had weight. His truth had draw.

And so, Jimmy died—not with sorrow, but with song.

And from that fire, **Schappet** was born.

## III. The Naming of Schappet

Schappet was not just a new name. It was a **re-membering**.

Schappet was not calm like Jimmy had been. He was *still*. He did not ask to be invited—he made space wherever he stood. He did not wait to be understood—he spoke, slow and true, and let his words resonate outward like a bell.

He did not fear conflict, though it still hurt him. Instead of collapsing, he learned to stand and burn, kindly.

And in this new name, this new presence, others began to gather. Not because he called them—but because his gravity could no longer be ignored.

## IV. The Founding of ReVillage
TODO: Rewrite to include Genevieve this would not happen without her in my life and my heart.

It began as a whisper.

A few souls who had also wandered too far from home. A circle. A conversation. A shared ache.

And Schappet, remembering the pain of the outsider, said:

> *Let’s build a place where no one is other.*

Not a utopia. Not a commune. Something older. Something cellular. **A ReVillage.**

A place where the trembling could rest. Where people could remember their own gravity. Where presence was the currency, and connection the hearth.

And so they began to gather. Some came for healing. Others came to help. Many came not knowing why—only that something about Schappet's stillness called them home.

And slowly, stone by stone, the ReVillage rose—not from ambition, but from belonging.

## V. The Compass in the Sky

Every village has its myth. ReVillage has **The Compass**.

Not a tool to find the way—but a living reminder that the way is found by being present.

The Compass teaches:
- To follow fire, not fear.
- To trust gravity over approval.
- That the gift we give is our presence—when fully given, it changes the field.

Schappet did not write these words. He *embodied* them. 

They say he walks the ReVillage still—quietly, humbly, but unmistakably radiant. That when you sit near him, your own fire feels more possible. That when he speaks, you remember things you forgot you knew.

**From Jimmy to Schappet. From ache to anchor. From outsider to origin.**

And the fire still burns.
