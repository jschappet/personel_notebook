Your Wedding (for You Alone)

The Setting

Not a rented hall, not a glossy venue — but a piece of land you love. A farm, a forest clearing, a meadow that feels alive. Cabins or tents, fire pits, hand-built toilets and kitchen. A place that smells of woodsmoke and earth. The kind of place you could stay a week without touching your phone.

The Flow of the Week

Days −3 to −1: The Gathering and Threshold
    •    A small group of your real people — not the “should invite” list — show up early. They help build the wedding itself.
    •    Building the toilets, setting up the kitchen, and decorating with herbs and flowers are the ritual: the work of hands grounding the work of hearts.
    •    Meals are humble and beautiful: rice, lentils, vegetables, butter, hard-boiled eggs, chai simmering in big pots. Cooked together, eaten sitting in circles.
    •    Evenings are fireside, with a mix of depth and play: songs, truth-speaking, sometimes silence, sometimes laughter.

Day 0: The Ceremony
    •    The ceremony doesn’t happen at an appointed hour with chairs and programs — it arises when you feel ready.
    •    People gather in a circle. The couple steps into the middle, witnessed.
    •    There are no “shoulds”: not white dresses, not rehearsed lines, not unity candles. Instead:
    •    Vows spoken in your own words.
    •    A silence held after each vow so the words sink in.
    •    Friends or family speaking meaning, not fluff.
    •    A blessing of hands or feet with water, earth, or herbs.
    •    Then: a shared meal under the trees. Simple, abundant, unrushed.
    •    As night falls: dancing and drumming for those who want, stillness by the fire for those who don’t.

Day +1: Integration
    •    The wedding isn’t over after the vows. The next day is for metabolizing what just happened.
    •    Morning circle: each person reflects what they saw, what it meant, what it awakened in them.
    •    You and your partner don’t just get celebrated — you get witnessed as changed beings.
    •    Afternoon: rest, wandering, playful games for those who want.
    •    Evening: gratitude circle, closing with soft music or silence.

Day +2: Farewell
    •    A slow morning walk across the land, pausing in silence, laying down offerings of flowers, stones, or prayers.
    •    Final communal meal.
    •    Departures unhurried. Some linger. The space slowly returns to quiet.

The Feel
    •    Nothing performative.
    •    Nothing ornamental unless it has soul.
    •    Depth and reflection at the core.
    •    Play is present but gentle, woven in — a song, a dance, an improv game by firelight — not a spectacle, but release.
    •    It feels like a rite of passage, not a party.
    •    And above all: you feel at home in it. At ease. No mask, no compromise.

This would be your absolute best wedding: a week-long slow ritual in nature, with community woven into the fabric, where the deepest meaning is honored, and where joy arises organically instead of being staged.

Do you want me to draft the actual words of the ceremony and circles — like the vows, the blessings, and the reflection prompts — so you could almost walk straight into it and it would be complete?
