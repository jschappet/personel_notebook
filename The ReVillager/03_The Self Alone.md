The first step is nearly always inward. I close my eyes.

Long ago, I discovered that my eyes are a floodgate. The volume of data they bring in overwhelms every other signal—internal sensations, intuitive whispers, the subtle energies that only speak when the world is quiet. So I shut down that system. I close them. Darkness becomes sanctuary.

Then comes breath. A few slow exhales. Nothing fancy—just enough to settle the heart rate and invite the parasympathetic in. I know the science, but this isn't for science. This is the doorway.

From here, one of two things happens. Sometimes I choose. Sometimes I wait. I might pick something—like telepathy—to gently explore. Other times, I listen for what wants to arrive.

There’s not a single marker that tells me I’m “there.” But something shifts. My mind clears. The noise dulls. There is an awareness that _something is different._

If I spent a whole day in that state, I suspect I might seem older—wiser, slower, tuned to something subtle. Maybe I’d only speak from _We._ Genevieve would recognize me. Others might not. Eating would slow into gratitude. Walking might become dancing. Movement would be joy, not effort.

What pulls me out? It could be anything: a phone buzz, a stray thought, or—like yesterday—the hot discomfort of too much sun, sweat pooling where I wished for stillness.

This self feels... human. Not animal, not divine. That level just above instinct, where awareness begins to flower. I think of Jim Carrey’s words:

> _"I am the universe experiencing Schappet."_

Yes. That.

This is what lives in the stillness of _The Self Alone._
