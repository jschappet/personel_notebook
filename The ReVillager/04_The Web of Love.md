# The Web of Love

Today I showed up in a circle. And I showed up whole.

My energy wasn’t just mine—it was holding the circle. Not by force or effort, but by presence. And in that presence, each person had space to be fully themselves. I was there, and so were they.

Marsha was in the circle too. I noticed how I've been filling her up with love, and how she’s been supporting me. That mutuality—it made both our hearts stronger. And I began to feel it wasn’t just between us. The connections were radiating outward, from each bond into a greater _mesh_—a web of heart connections.

I’m trying to name this shift. I used to see it as a circle of friends, 1-to-1 links. But now it’s more like an ecosystem. A web. A living net of support, nourishment, resonance.

There was a moment in the circle when I saw something clearly: my nervous system carries a pain I don’t always feel. And because of that, I’m drawn to care for the pain in others. It’s not martyrdom. It’s kinship. Someone saw my pain today—and I saw their care. And through that, I saw my own motivation more clearly than ever before.

We played _Next…_ in the circle. I offered it. Dennis said yes. Marsha began thinking. Matthis was still deep in his feeling. I asked him to start. And then I waited. No pushing. No fixing. Just letting the process unfurl. It was beautiful.

Before the circle, I said I wanted a _meaty_ one. This circle lived up to that.

And now I see something new: I want to be a **charging station** on this web of love. Yes, I want to be important. I want to have impact. I want to light people up and be lit up in return. My ego isn’t gone—but it’s growing up.

Today, I feel happy. Exuberant. Loving. I express acceptance of what is—at least as often as I can. And Matthis was right:

> _I am okay just as I am._

This is not a dream of becoming. This is a moment of _being._

This is the web of love, and I am in it.
