Before I ever tuned into love, I tuned into pain.

It started in my early 40s. I noticed energy moving through my body—not subtle like a passing thought, but palpable, electric, coursing. I went through a phase where I called myself an _energy vampire_. I wasn’t being ironic. I was feeding on other people’s trauma, or what Eckhart Tolle would call the _pain body._ I imagined I was helping move stuck energy, and maybe I was, but I was also taking something from it. Drawing from it. I needed it.

There was a kind of power in it. A rush. People would often have big emotional releases around me. They’d report feeling lighter, changed. Sometimes they’d even say their lives shifted after our interaction. That feedback fed something in me—maybe not just ego, but hunger. I wanted to matter. I wanted to be a conduit.

If I reach back further, the roots go deeper. I was raised in the Pentecostal church, where people laid hands to heal, where the Holy Spirit was expected to move through bodies—through mine. I don’t know if I ever fully believed it, but I also never fully doubted it. I witnessed people weep, shake, collapse under hands. I heard stories of transformation. That made an impression.

Even now, I remember the way it felt when they would pray over me. A heat. A pressure. A sense of being watched—by God, by the congregation, by myself.

> _[Do you remember the first time you laid hands on someone? What were you told would happen—and what did?]_

Somewhere along the way, the lines blurred. Between healing and feeding. Between witnessing and performing. Between channeling something real and amplifying something broken.

> _[When did you begin to feel conflicted about this phase? What made you change course?]_

It’s taken me time to see that what I once called “feeding” was a primitive form of tuning. I wasn’t wrong to feel something. I just hadn’t yet met the frequency of love.

This was the shadow side of my initiation. And it mattered.
