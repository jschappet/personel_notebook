**Legal and Organizational Structure**

ReVillage Society is currently structured as a church entity, which allows for religious and spiritual community-based gatherings and activities. This structure can support:
- Charitable donations with potential tax-deductibility
- Community housing and spiritual development programs
- Volunteer engagement and retreats

**Considerations for Inclusion and Investment:**
- Additional participants and supporters can be included as members, volunteers, or residents under the church umbrella.
- We may need to explore separate legal structures (such as a nonprofit or co-op) for broader investment models (e.g., from IRAs or program-related investments) depending on legal advice.
- The church structure supports mission alignment and protection for core values, and can coexist with more conventional entities if dual structure becomes necessary.
