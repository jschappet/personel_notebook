# ReVillage Society Member Handbook

_Living in Alignment with Ourselves, Each Other, and the Earth_

---

## Welcome

Welcome to **ReVillage Society**, a community rooted in self-responsibility, spiritual integrity, and the collective stewardship of life and land. This handbook is your invitation into our shared agreements, values, and rhythms.

We are not just members—we are co-stewards of a new way of living, learning, and regenerating.

> **TODO:** Consider adding a short story or anecdote from a founding moment or key gathering that illustrates the spirit of the community.

---

## What is ReVillage Society?

**ReVillage Society** is a **Private Membership Association (PMA)** and **Spiritual Fellowship** that exists outside the jurisdiction of public commercial law. We operate in the private domain—guided not by institutions or hierarchy, but by principles of mutual respect, consent, and care.

We are also anchored by the **ReVillage Stewardship Trust**, a private trust that holds land and resources for long-term, intergenerational use in service of our mission.

> **TODO:** Add a diagram showing the relationship between PMA, Trust, and Community.

## Core Agreements of Membership

By becoming a member of ReVillage Society, you agree to:

1. **Honor the Private Nature of This Fellowship**  
    All participation happens privately, between consenting members.
2. **Practice Self-Responsibility**  
    We do not rescue, fix, or manage one another. We choose to respond rather than react.
3. **Uphold Confidentiality and Consent**  
    What is shared in the circle stays in the circle.
4. **Align With Our Shared Values**  
    See the Core Values section below.
5. **Respect the Roles of Trustees and Stewards**  
    Trustees hold fiduciary duty for physical resources; stewards host relational and spiritual practices.

> **TODO:** Invite community input for any additional agreements or clarifications.
