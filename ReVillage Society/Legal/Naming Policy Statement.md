# ReVillage Society

#revillage/legal

**Purpose:**  
To maintain clarity, consistency, and legal distinction across the various organizational entities operating under the ReVillage Society umbrella, this Naming Policy defines the use of names for the Spiritual Private Membership Association and the related Private Trust.

---

### 1. Shared Brand Identity

All affiliated entities will share the root name **“ReVillage Society”** to reflect a unified mission, values, and community.

---

### 2. Distinct Entity Designations

To clearly differentiate the roles and legal functions of each entity, the following formal designations shall be used:

- **“ReVillage Society Spiritual Fellowship”** — Refers to the Private Membership Association (PMA) that governs membership, community activities, and spiritual practice.
    
- **“ReVillage Society Stewardship Trust”** — Refers to the Private Trust that holds and manages the assets, including land, funds, and resources, for the benefit of the community.

### 3. Usage Guidelines

- All official documents, agreements, contracts, and public communications shall use the full entity designation to avoid ambiguity.
    
- Informal or colloquial references may use “ReVillage Society” alone, provided the context is clear.
    
- When referencing either entity in combined communications, both designations may be used side-by-side for clarity.
    

---

### 4. Legal Considerations

- Neither entity is incorporated or registered as a business under state law; however, distinct names help maintain separate legal identities and responsibilities.
    
- Should incorporation, trademark, or other formal registrations occur in the future, this policy shall be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance and avoid conflicts.

### 5. Review

This Naming Policy shall be reviewed annually by the ReVillage Society Council of Stewards or as needed.
