# ReVillage Society Stewardship Trust

## Founders & Trustees Orientation Document

### Introduction

Welcome to the founding circle of **ReVillage Society**—a living experiment in community stewardship, regenerative culture, and spiritual integrity. You have stepped into a sacred trust: to protect and guide resources not as owners, but as **caretakers for future generations**.

This document outlines the distinct roles, values, and responsibilities of **Founders**, **Settlor(s)**, and **Trustees**, ensuring clarity, alignment, and long-term resilience.

---

##  1. Founders' Role

Founders are those who carry the original seed vision of ReVillage Society. You have held and nurtured:

- The soul of this work
- The foundational values
- The spark that ignites co-creation

While your role may evolve, you will always be **keepers of the flame**—invited to ensure that future growth remains in integrity with the original spirit of the village.

> _“We hold the threshold. We light the torch. We do not control the fire.”_

## 2. Settlor Role

The **Settlor** is the individual or collective who legally **creates the Trust** by:

- Declaring its formation
- Contributing initial property (land, funds, tools, etc.)
- Naming the first Trustees

This is a primarily **ceremonial and initiating role**. After the Trust is established, the Settlor may step back, remain involved as a guide, or serve as a Trustee (with care to avoid conflicts of interest).

### Core Spirit of the Settlor:

- Anchors the vision
- Initiates but does not control
- Seeds the beginning, but honors what grows

---

## 3. Trustee Role

Trustees are the **legal stewards** of the Trust's assets. You are responsible for:

- **Holding legal title** to all trust property
- **Managing all resources** (land, money, structures) in alignment with the trust’s purpose
- **Making decisions** that protect and support the community
- **Operating with fiduciary integrity** and transparency

### A Trustee’s Mandate:

- To act with care, loyalty, and prudence
- To listen deeply to the community while upholding the trust’s mission
- To protect the assets not as owners, but as humble servants of the whole

---

## 4. Core Values Guiding Our Roles

All roles—Founder, Settlor, Trustee—are bound together by shared principles:

- **Self-Responsibility:** Each person is a sovereign being, accountable for their impact.
- **Autonomy and Consent:** Participation is voluntary, and governance is grounded in relational integrity.
- **Stewardship over Ownership:** Assets are cared for in service of the community and future.
- **Spiritual Integrity:** We act in alignment with what is sacred, meaningful, and life-giving.
- **Community Good:** We make decisions through the lens of the whole, not personal gain.

---

## 5. Accountability & Reflection

All founders and trustees are invited to:

- Attend seasonal **Steward Circles** for renewal, alignment, and recalibration
- Participate in **Transparency Reviews**, where trust decisions are shared with community members
- Engage in **Conflict Repair** processes if integrity breaks down

This is not merely legal governance—it is **spiritual stewardship**.
