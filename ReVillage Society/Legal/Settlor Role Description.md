### **Settlor Role Description**

The **Settlor** of the _ReVillage Society Stewardship Trust_ is the individual or entity who initiates the trust by:

- **Declaring its formation** through a trust deed or declaration;
    
- **Defining the purpose and principles** by which the Trust shall be governed;
    
- **Transferring initial assets** (such as land, funds, or other property) into the Trust;
    
- **Appointing the first Trustees** to manage the Trust according to its purpose.
    

The Settlor holds a **foundational and ceremonial role**. Once the Trust is established and the Trustees have accepted their responsibilities, the Settlor may:

- Step back from further active involvement,
    
- Retain a ceremonial advisory role (non-binding),
    
- Or serve concurrently as a Trustee, if desired and not in conflict with fiduciary ethics.
    

The Settlor's deeper function is to **anchor the trust's vision and values** at its birth, ensuring alignment with the spiritual, communal, and regenerative mission of ReVillage Society.
