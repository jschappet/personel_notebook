# Gentle Guide Rails for Fighting Well

_A living guide for Genevieve & Schappet to nurture conflict as a path to deeper intimacy._

---

## Introduction

This booklet is our shared anchor for moments when tension rises. Fighting well does not mean avoiding conflict, but leaning into it with care, awareness, and respect. These guide rails remind us that even in rupture, we are on the same team.

Conflict in relationships brings people closer by shining light on the blocks, walls, and judgments that tend to separate and divide us. Our goal is to uncover the needs that have never had a safe place to be expressed. Each person in the relationship has valid needs, and when those needs stay hidden, people often lean on unconscious behaviors to get them met. Anger, blame, manipulation, force, power, and control all leak out when needs are un-owned.

## Shared Agreements

Here’s a first sketch of a **step-by-step method** based on what you just named:\

**1. What matters most right now**

Each person names: “The thing that feels most important to me in this moment is…”\

**2. Energy vs. frustration check**

Each person notes: “My energy feels ___ right now. My frustration feels ___.” (Simple scale, like 1–10, or just descriptive words.)\

**3. Immediate feelings + fears**

Name the raw, closest feelings: “I feel… I’m afraid that…”

**4. Moving closer to the cause**

Ask: “What’s the most tender or threatened thing underneath this activation?”\

**5. Moving away from blame**

If blame shows up, pause and reframe: “Instead of what they did, what’s the impact on me?”

## Signals and Signs

Before we can start to fight well, we need to step back and look at the indications that we are actually in a conflict. Some of the classic signs are raised voices—some people might call this yelling! One of my favorites is the use of **always/never language** (e.g., “You always…” / “You never…”), or worse yet, the accusatory **“Why did you do that?!”**

Another sign can be traced through the **Attachment Regulation Spectrum** (popularized by Sue Johnson and others). People may shift into “hot” activation (yelling, pressing in, demanding connection) or “cold” activation (shutting down, withdrawing, moving away). These aren’t random choices—they’re nervous system responses. Hot activation shows up as pursuing, protesting, or clinging. Cold activation looks like pulling back, numbing, or going silent. Both are signals that something important feels at risk.

Withdrawal and moving away can be particularly sneaky signs of conflict. Instead of a fight, it looks like _less connection_—less eye contact, fewer words, more scrolling or distractions. But it’s just as much part of the conflict pattern.

A more subtle cue is **defensiveness**. This might look like:

- Explaining before listening
    
- Reversing blame (“Well you did this first…”)
    
- Shifting the topic away from accountability
    
- Using sarcasm or humor to deflect
    

It’s worth noting: defensiveness isn’t just “bad behavior.” Often, it’s a sign of care—the person feels accused or misunderstood and is trying to protect their sense of self. In our relating practices, we can meet defensiveness with curiosity (“What feels at stake for you right now?”) rather than more attack.

## What Helps in the Heat

- A 3-minute pause with no talking, just breathing.
    
- Saying: _“I care too much about this relationship to fight like this.”_
    
- Holding hands while continuing to speak (if possible).
    
- Asking: _“What do you need most right now?”_
    
- Letting one person speak for 2 minutes, uninterrupted.
    

---

## Repair Rituals

After conflict, how we return:

- Take space if needed, then reconnect with presence.
    
- Begin with: _“I’m ready to reconnect. Are you?”_
    
- Each names: _What hurt me / What I needed._
    
- A shared breath or hug, if welcomed.
    
- Optionally: re-do the moment with words we wish we had used.

## Growth Edges

Growth edges are places where anyone can try something a bit more vulnerable or connecting. One of the biggest challenges in a conflict is to actively create distance for yourself. This most often means saying No to your partner. A great way to stay in connection while still saying no, is to offer an alternative. Something like, "No, I don't want to talk about this right now, instead I would love to go for a walk and reset. Can we talk when I get back?" There are places for each Zone to move back towards connection.

**Red Zone:**

- Trusting your partner's need for space without fearing abandonment.
    
- Expressing hurt directly without blame.
    

**Blue Zone:**

- Pausing before explaining or fixing.
    
- Allowing anger without shutting down or pleasing.

## Reminders We Love

- _“It’s not me vs. you, it’s us vs. the misunderstanding.”_
    
- _“I call myself back from the tremble. I belong in my own center.”_
    
- _“Help is not to fix, but to face what’s real together.”_
    

## Asking for Help

In circling and relational practices, asking for help is not just about fixing a problem—it’s about opening a door for connection. Here are some ways this can show up:

- **Voicing inner experience**: “I’m noticing I feel overwhelmed right now and could use a pause—can you slow down with me?”
    
- **Inviting support**: “I want to share this story, but I might need you to just listen without jumping in. Can you do that?”
    
- **Naming limits**: “I feel myself shutting down. Could you check in with me instead of pushing?”
    
- **Requesting presence**: “Could you just sit with me here for a moment, even without words?”
    
- **Owning the tender edge**: “It’s hard for me to admit I need help, but I want to try—could you reflect back what you’re hearing so I know I’m not alone in this?”
    

In our practice, asking for help is a form of intimacy. It acknowledges vulnerability while also trusting that the other person has the capacity to respond. Every time we ask, we weave another thread of connection, building resilience in the relationship.

### Schappet’s Conflict Cycle Map

_(A guide for staying in the love field when conflict rises)_

#### 1. Early Warning Signs

- I notice my mind making **stories about the other**.
    
- I start **explaining myself** rather than just being with what’s happening.
    

#### 2. Leaving the Love Field

- I begin to **retreat inward**, with the sense: _“I won’t be understood.”_
    
- I stop trying to share, believing there’s no point.
    

#### 3. What Helps Me Return to Safety

- **Neutral acknowledgment / mirroring**:
    
    - “I heard you say…”
        
    - “I translate that to mean…”
        
- Must be **without shame or judgment.**
    

#### 4. What I Want From My Partner When I’m Scared

- Recognition: _“I see you are scared or retreating.”_
    
- Invitation: _“Are you open to… / would you like… / can we…?”_
    

#### 5. What I Offer My Partner When They’re Scared

- Instead of defending intention, I slow down.
    
- Words I can use:
    
    - _“I hear you are scared. Is there something you need?”_
        

#### 6. My Pause Signals

- Verbal: _“Pause.”_ / _“Please stop talking.”_
    
- Nonverbal: raise my hand.
    
- If needed: walk away with a **clear plan to return in X minutes**.
    

#### 7. My Grounding Reminders During Pause

- _“I am okay.”_
    
- _“I am not wrong or bad.”_
    
- _“A mistake is not a moral failure.”_
    
- _“I will not be punished for being human.”_
    

#### 8. Returning from Pause

- My cool-off is quick; I’m often ready right away.
    
- I wait for **my partner’s signal of safety** — a shift from “you’re still mad at me” → “we’re okay / safe.”
    

#### 9. Closure

- I don’t need a neat solution.
    
- What matters is a **felt release** — some catharsis that shows movement, not stuckness.

Absolutely — here’s a summary of the bottom-up relational conflict practice we’ve been building and what’s still open to refine:

⸻

Current Plan (Bottom-Up, Body-Guided)

1. Baseline / Safety Anchor
    •    Each person finds a point of security in their body (“core,” root to throat).
    •    Short verbal affirmation to self:
“I am loved. He loves me. I love myself. I’m scared, and that’s ok. I am not as disconnected as I feel.”
    •    Optional gentle touch and shared tuning: hand on arm, synchronized breath.
    •    Shared verbal acknowledgment: “Your fear matters to me.”

2. Recognize Activation
    •    Identify panic, fear, catastrophizing: “I am scared and that’s ok.”
    •    Notice somatic signs: gut clenching, fast/intense energy vs. calm warmth in core.
    •    Distinguish between “fast/attacking/intense” vs. “grounded in love field.”

3. Shared Rhythm
    •    Built-in check-ins: “Are we pushing each other away or resourced enough to stay in the love field?”
    •    If resourced: continue exploring, alternating 5-minute inward turns.
    •    If activation rises: return to anchor, repeat affirmations, gentle touch, breathing.

4. Exploring Needs
    •    During inward turns, notice the part that wants to escape, withdraw, or push.
    •    Identify one thing each part could hear to feel safer or seen.
    •    Focus on body sensations and the field of love, not just mental content.

5. Mirroring / Shared Expression
    •    Each person expresses fear verbally: “I’m scared”.
    •    Partner responds: “Your fear matters to me.”
    •    Optional hand squeeze / touch to reinforce connection.
    •    Maintain attention on self, partner, and shared field.

6. Micro-Pauses & Repair
    •    Say: “I’m scared, can we slow down?” as needed.
    •    Partner responds verbally and physically: “I will slow down with you. I value your feelings.”
    •    Monitor calm warmth vs. clenching stomach to confirm love field.

7. Grounding Through Cycles
    •    Repeat affirmation and touch cycles as needed.
    •    Keep each exploratory turn short (~5 minutes) to prevent overwhelm.
    •    Focus on return to love field before diving into next activation.

⸻

What’s Left to Cover / Refine
    1.    Conflict escalation beyond panic
    •    What if one or both of you cannot access calm warmth? How do you stay safe and connected in those moments?
    2.    Transition from exploration to resolution or repair
    •    After inward turns, how do you gently move toward clarity, reconciliation, or decision-making (if needed) without problem-solving too early?
    3.    Integration of historical patterns
    •    How to notice recurring “old wounds” during these cycles and prevent them from hijacking the present?
    4.    Optional external support
    •    Guidelines for when to bring in outside help or check-in with a trusted third party if activation is too high.
    5.    Shared micro-practices for daily life
    •    Anchors, verbal cues, or brief rituals you can use outside of high-conflict moments to maintain relational field and trust.


### Fighting Well: Bottom-Up Cheat Sheet

#### 1. Find Safety Anchor
    •    Self: Core/root to throat grounding, repeat:
“I am loved. He loves me. I love myself. I’m scared, and that’s ok. I am not as disconnected as I feel.”
    •    Shared: Hand on arm or touch if available, repeat:
“Your fear matters to me.”
    •    Body check: Calm warmth vs. clenching stomach.

⸻

#### 2. Recognize Activation
    •    Notice panic/fear: gut rip, fast intensity, catastrophizing thoughts.
    •    Distinguish:
    •    Fast/attacking/intense → danger/panic
    •    Calm love field → safe, warm, connected

⸻

#### 3. Micro-Practices to Return to Love Field
    •    Repeat affirmations:
“I will be heard. Everything important will be heard. My needs matter.”
    •    Gentle touch or hand squeeze if possible.
    •    Say aloud or internally — whichever feels right.
    •    Use short breaths and focus on body sensations.

⸻

#### 4. Tether When One Withdraws
    •    Trigger: Panic rising, partner withdrawing
    •    Verbal anchor:
“You matter to me. The thing you find important is important to me. I want to hear you.”
    •    Response options: hand squeeze, simple acknowledgment.
    •    Repeat as needed, at fear spikes.

⸻

#### 5. Listening Cycles (5-Minute Turns)
    1.    Check-in: “Are we resourced enough to stay in the love field?”
    2.    Inward turn: 5 minutes each — notice parts, body, fear, or need to escape.
    3.    Micro-step: if fear rises → repeat anchor phrases, hand squeeze, or “I notice” rounds.
    4.    Return: once calm warmth returns, check: “Are we ready to initiate the listening protocol?”

⸻

#### 6. Hand Signal / Pause System
- Raise hand: activation, blame, panic, or need to pause.
- Partner response: pause, close eyes, take deep breath, notice own body
- Re-anchor: “Both of us will be heard. Both feelings matter. We are in this together.”


#### 7. Speaking & Mirroring
    •    When sharing fear: “I’m scared” → partner responds: “Your fear matters to me.”
    •    Fast frustration cue: notice, stop projection, return to self-ownership.
    •    Optional direct expression:
“I want you to respond differently. I want to feel loved.”
    •    Partner stays soft, verbalizes care, reinforces safety.

#### 8. Ending / Closure
    •    After cycles, if both resourced → natural closure emerges.
    •    Optional: reflect on what was heard, validate each other’s feelings.


#### Quick Prompts
    •    “I’m scared and that’s ok.” → anchor
    •    “Your fear matters to me.” → tether / mirror
    •    “Are we resourced enough?” → check-in
    •    Raise hand → pause, re-anchor
    •    “Both feelings matter. We are in this together.” → restore love field
