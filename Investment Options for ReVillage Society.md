### 1. **Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) Investments**

A Self-Directed IRA allows individuals to invest in alternative assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, such as real estate and private equity. Frank could potentially use an SDIRA to invest in ReVillage Society, provided the investment doesn't constitute a prohibited transaction (e.g., self-dealing). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-directed_IRA?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Considerations:**

- The SDIRA must be managed by a qualified custodian.
    
- Investments must adhere to IRS regulations to avoid penalties.
    

### 2. **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)**

If Frank is 70½ or older, he can make a QCD of up to $100,000 annually directly from his IRA to a qualified charity, potentially satisfying his required minimum distribution (RMD) without increasing his taxable income. [Schwab Brokerage](https://www.dafgiving360.org/giving-with-ira?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Note:** ReVillage Society would need to be a 501(c)(3) organization to receive QCDs.

### 3. **Program-Related Investments (PRIs)**

PRIs are investments made by foundations to support charitable activities that involve the potential return of capital within an established time frame. While typically used by private foundations, understanding PRIs can be beneficial if ReVillage Society seeks funding from such entities.
