## 1 Start of Fight
_Image: A circle with Home in the center, Then an outer ring labeled Community is the same as home_ 

### "Wait thats a lot"

### What do you mean, that just how I am?

### That feels like a punch.

I want you to soften, and understand me here instead of defending + attacking me here
- This is another trigger inner child, I am hurt here + I told you


## 2 Layers of my Responses 

A) I wanted to know about the fight with you + Guillaume -- Because I care about how we think about community
B) I feel scared about both the emptiness of convo about new community and the fullness of the vision for community. The two together seem childish, confuse me. 
C) Small amount of Woah - so many times this merging thing "" without tuning "" -- Not sure if I transcribe this correctly.-- has been dangerous.

Why is it so hard to go into the middle of this?
- **inner child question: Can I trust my partner here - not about sex just about trust he('s) got the structure**
This is why I'm triggered
