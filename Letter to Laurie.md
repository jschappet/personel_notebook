**Dear Laurie,**

I've been avoiding saying anything about this, unsure of how to speak to it without adding more tension or misunderstanding. And it's continues to be on my heart.

I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge something that may have caused discomfort or concern, and to speak directly from my heart.

I made an offer to be present with Karl through his journey — to listen, to accompany, and simply to not let him go through this alone. In response, he asked if there was anything I wanted in exchange. I answered honestly in that moment, perhaps too bluntly: I mentioned his home.

Looking back, I can understand how that might have felt — transactional, inappropriate, or even opportunistic. That wasn’t my intention, but I take full responsibility for the impact it may have had. It was a moment of raw honesty, not a request or expectation. “No” would have — and still does — feel like a completely valid and welcomed answer.

My intention was never about ownership, but about honoring the vision Karl has carried for the property and its potential to serve as a place of connection and community — a way of extending his legacy, not claiming it.

I’m not seeking anything from you or from him. I’m not trying to insert myself where I’m not wanted. My only wish is for peace around this — for dignity, for civility, and for space to continue being present with Karl in the ways he wants.

If I’ve caused offense or mistrust, I truly regret that. My hope is simply to reset things — back to neutral, back to respect, even if we don’t share more than that.

With care and sincerity,  
**Jimmy**
