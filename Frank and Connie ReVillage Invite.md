**Dear Frank and Connie,**

I hope this note finds you well. I’ve always appreciated the way we’ve stayed in touch over the years, and how you have held me with love. I’ve been reflecting lately on the people in my life who have helped shape me into who I am—people who value family, community, and the importance of doing right by others. Each of you are one of those people.

I’m writing to share something that has become a deeply rooted calling for me: the creation of **ReVillage Society**—a community-centered initiative designed to bring people together around shared values of care, connection, and sustainable living. We are in the early stages of raising funds for a property here in Mount Vernon, which we envision as the first home and gathering place for this work.

ReVillage Society is about reweaving the fabric of local life—supporting parents, elders, and children with real, grounded togetherness; building a place where people can grow food, hold meaningful conversations, and learn to show up for one another with integrity and compassion. It’s not a utopia—it’s a chance to build something practical and heartfelt in a world that feels more fragmented by the day.

I wanted to reach out and invite you to consider being part of this effort. Whether through a donation or an investment, your support could be instrumental in helping us purchase this first property and lay the foundation for what’s to come. If it’s of interest, I’d also be happy to talk through potential options for supporting ReVillage through retirement accounts or other investment vehicles.

I’d love to share more if you’re curious. No pressure at all—just deep appreciation for the connection we’ve shared, and a sense that you might resonate with this vision in some way.

With warmth and respect,  
[Your Name]
