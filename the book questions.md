- Where are you now, three years from this moment?
- What is different about your day-to-day life?
- What do people know you for?
- What moment confirmed that you had “made it”?
- What kind of person did you have to become to live into this?

  

  

  

  

  

The Beginning:

  

  

- What was the earliest tug toward “the hill”? Was it a word, a dream, a whisper, a memory?
- What wasn’t working in your life that made this vision necessary?
- Was there a moment you almost gave up before you even began?

  

  

  

  

  

The Compass:

  

  

- What does the Compass symbolize for you?
- How did it come into your life—through insight, practice, art, relationship?
- What are the qualities or directions it holds?
- How did you learn to orient by it?

  

  

  

  

  

Gathering:

  

  

- Who were the first people to truly understand what you were doing?
- What forms of resistance or misunderstanding did you encounter?
- What sources of funding, land, or knowledge showed up unexpectedly?
- How did synchronicity guide your journey?

  

  

  

  

  

Turning Points:

  

  

- What crisis or collapse made you pivot or recommit?
- What part of yourself had to die for the next phase to begin?
- What did “community” begin to mean in a new way?

  

  

  

  

  

The Hill:

  

  

- Where is the hill, literally or symbolically?
- What did reaching it reveal that the journey itself could not?
- Did you go alone, or did others arrive with you?
