MG:
	So….uh…the “thing” is a thing! Scoring concert tickets for a huge show for September. 
	And we shared our songs of heartbreak. 

JCS:
	Aww, so happy with you! 

MG:
	And I have agreed to be “a node in the musical network”…not gatekeeping his friends. AND is requesting Zoom. I’m kinda overwhelmed! 

JCS:
	I trust your overwhelm. What does the overwhelmed it have to say?

MG:
	It says “nobody’s been interested like this…it’s so different…I like it but I’m scared! 

JCS:
	You like the feeling of someone moving towards you? You are scared of someone over taking you? (Guessing here at the end)
	I love chatting like this.

MG:
	Yeah I really like it. Not overtaking…but scared of having it taken away. 

JCS:
	Does the scared have more to say?

MG:
	I wish I wasn’t so scared. 
	I wish I found safe secure intimacy, but I won’t dare allow myself to hope. 

JCS:
	Will you try an experiment with me?

JCS:
	What can you see from your vantage point at the edge of the forest?

MG:
	The golden light shines over a vast field of grasses. I see a building in the distance…there are some trees….the vista is very open
	There is nothing that looks anywhere near dangerous…but I am still hyper alert 

JCS:
	What do you hear from your vantage point at the edge of forest?

MG:
	The soft rustling murmur of the grasses moving in a slight breeze
	There is no bird sounds 
	It looks very inviting…but there could be…things in the grass

JCS:
	Do you want to go investigate the grasses to see what’s there? Or maybe there is a path?

MG:
	I don’t see a path. The grasses might feel delicious walking through it. Maybe it would taste good. Maybe there would be good things in the grass. Maybe there would be good things near the building

JCS:
	Do I sense some curiosity? 

MG:
	Yes!

JCS:
	Excitement?

MG:
	Some…

JCS:
	Worry?

MG:
	Less worry than a insane amount of hyper alertness

JCS:
	When you say insane, I hear an evaluation, which in my book means judgement.

MG:
	Yeah it feels very intense
	I’m very glad he wants to  go voice/vid
	I think what might be messing with me is absorbing so much in a really short and limitedly connected format. 

JCS:
	Makes sense! I worry it might feel like love bombing.
	
MG:
	I think it might…but it doesn’t have that sexual component pushed with it
	I think he is being careful and deliberate. 
	I’m totally not used to that. 
	He’s had A LOT of therapy. 
	It doesn’t feel like love bombing….it’s a whole lot of sharing. Verbal and musical. 

JCS:
	It makes sense to be scared, the love you feel can be lost.

MG:
	Oh! I’ve never had so many new sounds poured into me before! 
	I’ve never been with someone who feels in music! 
	I think that’s it!

JCS:
	You think its overwhelming to have someone interested in you who feels music in a way similar to you, I imagine you feel inspired by the new content.

MG:
	Yup

JCS:
	The fear of the loss hurts?

MG:
	Yup in my stomach
	But I’m not that afraid. There will be tickets for Sept tomorrow. There is  solidity in it.
	There’s a solidity to him that I really like
	
JCS:
	Scheduling something for September does have a stability to it

MG:
	Yup 
	And he’s going to the same show as I am next week so we’ll get face time
	I’m smiling 
	I have to run out of the house now…late… Thank you SO MUCH
	This is the first time ever I’ve turned to a male friend to unpack relationship stuff, so that means secure attachment!! 
	💗
	Love you! 💗💗

JCS:
	Aww. Love you! 

MG:
	You both hug each other pretending it’s me that’s hugging you both, k? 

JCS:
	I’ll put my arm around her, she’s sitting right next to me.

MG:
	Yay
