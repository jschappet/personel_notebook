# The Border Zone Is Not Neutral: A Wake-Up Call from the Edge
## _Why the "100-Mile Border Zone" isn't just about geography—it’s about ideology._

By Schappet

Nearly two-thirds of Americans—about 200 million people—live within 100 miles of a U.S. land or coastal border. This region, dubbed the “100-mile border zone,” spans our most populated cities and coastlines. It’s also where the U.S. government grants extraordinary authority to Customs and Border Protection (CBP): warrantless searches, checkpoints, and surveillance—all justified in the name of national security.

But there’s something we need to talk about. These policies don’t land evenly. They land, more often than not, on the communities that lean left—immigrant-rich neighborhoods, urban centers, culturally progressive enclaves. In the name of national defense, we are redrawing the boundaries of civil liberty. And we’re doing it under the illusion of neutrality.

## National Defense Isn’t a Shared Priority

The defense-first framework that justifies expanded authority in the 100-mile zone presumes consensus: that national security should take precedence over personal privacy, freedom of movement, and community sovereignty. But that’s not a shared value. For many of us—especially those on the political left—security means something different. It means being safe *from* the state, not just *by* it. It means belonging without being watched. It means liberty before enforcement.

To claim that these border policies are apolitical is to erase the lived reality of those most impacted. It’s not just geography—it’s ideology. And the burden isn’t evenly shared.

## A Subtle Form of Ideological Control

Yes, conservative and rural communities also live within the border zone. But the concentration of enforcement and surveillance tends to focus on “threat profiles” that skew immigrant, urban, and poor. The logic of national defense often maps perfectly onto right-leaning priorities—immigration crackdowns, strong policing, and surveillance—as if those values were universally held. They’re not. They're just dominant.

This is a subtler kind of gerrymandering: not of votes, but of **rights**. A slow erosion of constitutional protections, distributed unevenly across the political spectrum and masked by a rhetoric of neutrality.

## Binary Collapse and the Illusion of Safety

What we’re witnessing is a collapse of the binary between "safety" and "freedom." We're told we can only have one. But this is a false choice. The 100-mile zone policies ask us to sacrifice one kind of safety (freedom from state overreach) in order to protect another (freedom from foreign threat). That trade-off reflects a distinctly militarized worldview—one that aligns more with conservative narratives of control than with pluralistic visions of care, community, and consent.

The concept of **binary collapse** teaches us to see beyond false oppositions. Left vs. right. Security vs. liberty. Inside vs. outside. When we collapse those binaries, we see the border not as a line, but as a field—an energetic zone of transformation. But instead of healing or bridging, our current policies harden this field into one of surveillance and control.

## A Different Kind of Safety

If we’re serious about reimagining the future of this country—its values, its communities, its shared space—then we need to ask: What kind of safety are we creating? Who benefits from it? Who pays for it?

And are we willing to keep living under a system that quietly redraws the social contract—just because we’ve been told it’s about “defense”?
